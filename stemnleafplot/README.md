**Stem and Leaf Plot**

The goal of this project is to plot a stem and leaf visualizations of the most important words and their derivatives in all of the diversity statements made by CS organizations and universities about anti-racism, police brutality, and protests.

The newest version of the code is in the **finalversion-stemnleafplot** folder. This folder contains a jupyter notebook and a python script of the stem and leaf plot code. This code outputs the stem and leaf plot of the most important words in all of the diversity statements and their derivatives. The folder contains the printed result of the stem and leaf plot saved as a markdown document and a text document. The folder also contains the direct output of the entire dictionary of stem & leaves saved as stemnleaf.json.

The older version of the code is in **original-stemnleafplot**. There is a jupyter notebook in this folder that contains the stem and leaf plot code. This code outputs the stem and leaf plot of the uniquewordlist.txt and all of the diversity statements.

In the **unused-code** folder, there is two jupyter notebooks that contain code that has not been used in the newer version. However, they contain useful functions such as removing punctuation from a text, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing words.
