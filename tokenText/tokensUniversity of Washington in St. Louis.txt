dear, washington, university, community, to, say, that, this, ha, been, a, difficult, and, painful, week, would, be, an, extreme, understatement, like, you, i, watched, with, sadness, and, grief, a, event, have, unfolded, first, in, minneapolis, in, response, to, the, kill, of, george, floyd, and, then, across, the, country, a, individual, and, community, have, taken, to, the, street, to, express, their, anger, and, frustration, at, the, racial, injustice, that, continues, to, plague, our, nation, the, ongo, racial, violence, that, we, are, wit, against, people, of, color, is, noth, short, of, devast, in, recent, month, we, have, seen, a, rise, in, and, violence, largely, perpetuated, by, other, american, in, the, last, two, week, we, have, seen, the, continuation, of, violence, against, black, american, both, at, the, hand, of, officer, of, the, state, and, private, individual, the, event, of, the, past, several, day, reflect, only, the, most, recent, in, a, long, line, of, wrong, that, have, been, inflicted, upon, our, community, of, color, here, in, louis, we, are, all, too, familiar, with, the, refrain, of, those, who, are, committed, to, address, issue, of, inequality, and, racism, no, justice, no, peace, given, our, commitment, to, activism, and, social, justice, it, no, surprise, that, the, louis, community, ha, joined, the, call, to, action, and, i, heartened, to, see, the, passion, that, drive, our, friend, and, neighbor, to, make, their, voice, heard, i, also, am, deeply, concerned, for, the, of, our, community, and, remain, committed, to, work, toward, a, constructive, path, forward, in, our, region, that, tackle, structural, disparity, and, inequity, i, spent, a, lot, of, time, this, weekend, think, and, engag, in, conversation, with, other, university, leader, about, how, we, can, best, support, our, community, and, advance, the, cause, of, racial, justice, dure, this, time, what, we, could, say, or, do, that, would, bring, comfort, to, those, who, are, hurt, and, show, solidarity, with, those, who, are, take, action, given, the, enormity, of, the, issue, before, u, we, know, without, question, that, word, are, not, enough, and, that, no, statement, will, begin, to, resolve, the, tremendous, challenge, that, are, still, before, u, and, yet, there, are, some, thing, that, are, important, to, say, first, we, must, acknowledge, those, who, are, suffer, to, our, student, faculty, staff, and, any, other, member, of, our, community, who, are, feel, targeted, unheard, or, unsupported, we, see, you, and, are, here, for, you, our, commitment, to, diversity, and, inclusion, mean, more, than, just, welcom, every, person, into, our, community, it, mean, valu, you, a, individual, with, your, own, identity, actively, acknowledg, that, you, matter, and, unwaveringly, support, your, right, to, be, treated, fairly, and, equally, in, every, aspect, of, our, society, we, stand, with, you, and, condemn, all, act, of, hate, aggression, or, disrespect, toward, any, racial, group, that, may, happen, anywhere, in, our, community, our, region, our, country, or, the, world, we, are, committed, to, support, all, member, of, our, community, and, we, must, redouble, our, effort, to, achieve, the, equity, that, is, foundational, to, foster, this, environment, in, addition, we, remain, committed, to, make, a, difference, after, the, kill, of, michael, brown, in, ferguson, in, our, washington, university, community, began, the, long, process, of, look, inward, to, see, how, we, could, create, space, for, honest, dialogue, about, race, ethnicity, inequality, and, social, justice, how, we, could, do, better, and, be, better, since, that, time, we, have, taken, step, a, a, community, to, become, more, fully, engaged, on, these, issue, and, to, work, toward, positive, change, at, our, most, recent, day, of, dialogue, and, action, this, spring, we, reaffirmed, our, commitment, to, creat, intentional, space, to, listen, extend, empathy, celebrate, and, engage, in, dialogue, in, hope, of, reflect, on, our, own, humanity, and, the, humanity, of, others, the, event, of, this, week, are, a, painful, reminder, of, how, much, work, we, all, still, have, to, do, a, a, nation, and, a, a, society, finally, we, must, take, action, this, includes, not, only, support, our, community, but, also, do, what, is, at, the, core, of, our, mission, leverag, our, activity, in, support, of, research, teach, and, patient, care, to, make, a, difference, in, help, to, forward, the, cause, of, racial, and, social, justice,

to, support, listen, to, and, learn, from, one, another, we, are, all, struggl, with, the, disconnection, from, our, peer, friend, and, support, network, especially, dure, this, time, of, additional, stress, but, this, only, make, our, need, to, create, space, for, engagement, within, our, community, even, more, urgent, and, we, are, work, toward, way, to, do, that, in, the, day, ahead, in, the,
