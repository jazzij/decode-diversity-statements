black, lives, matter, a, gso, perspective, aerial, view, of, the, uri, narragansett, bay, campus, june, a, statement, from, uri, graduate, school, of, oceanography, dean, bruce, corliss, i, am, writing, to, follow, up, my, statement, last, week, in, on, the, waterfront, should, you, not, have, had, the, opportunity, to, read, it, the, senseless, death, of, george, floyd, has, created, despair, and, anger, across, the, country, and, as, the, uri, senior, leadership, team, stated, in, a, recent, email, is, a, reminder, of, the, oppression, and, injustice, still, too, prevalent, in, our, society, the, graduate, school, of, oceanography, and, the, university, of, rhode, island, are, committed, to, a, more, just, and, equitable, society, and, university, community, i, write, to, that, commitment, to, promote, and, respect, diversity, and, justice, for, all, within, our, campus, and, within, the, nation, as, we, struggle, to, address, systemic, problems, within, our, society, and, across, the, country, the, death, of, george, floyd, and, racism, together, with, a, lack, of, progress, to, address, the, roots, of, these, crimes, have, led, to, frustration, and, anger, generated, by, police, brutality, racial, injustice, and, a, culture, among, some, that, condones, violence, this, anger, is, also, based, on, societal, and, structural, racism, that, has, pervaded, the, fabric, of, america, societal, racism, includes, inequalities, in, distribution, availability, of, health, care, and, affordable, health, insurance, and, educational, opportunities, and, is, perpetuated, not, only, by, individuals, and, institutions, but, by, lawmakers, passing, legislation, that, precludes, or, limits, opportunity, to, minority, communities, and, in, particular, to, black, americans, politics, matter, these, societal, and, financial, inequities, have, existed, for, a, very, long, time, and, the, lack, of, progress, to, address, these, inequities, is, at, the, core, of, the, problem, that, the, country, faces, today, gso, has, actively, made, efforts, to, attract, minority, faculty, and, students, in, general, and, specifically, african, americans, to, join, gso, and, will, continue, to, do, so, in, addition, professional, societies, have, fostered, and, reinforced, the, need, to, increase, underrepresented, minorities, in, the, sciences, and, in, particular, black, americans, but, clearly, we, as, an, institution, and, a, discipline, must, hold, ourselves, accountable, and, do, better, it, is, time, to, reflect, upon, and, then, redouble, our, efforts, to, ensure, that, current, and, prospective, faculty, students, and, staff, of, color, feel, that, they, belong, and, are, supported, the, gso, faculty, voted, last, year, to, remove, the, gre, test, requirement, in, graduate, applications, as, this, has, been, shown, to, be, a, bias, against, minority, students, this, year, a, noaa, proposal, was, submitted, to, recruit, and, provide, support, to, summer, students, from, the, university, of, maryland, eastern, shore, a, historically, black, college, and, university, hbcu, as, part, of, our, cinar, effort, an, effort, that, follows, a, commitment, we, made, last, year, when, we, submitted, the, cooperative, institute, proposal, we, also, reached, out, this, year, to, another, hbcu, institution, elizabeth, city, university, in, north, carolina, to, inquire, about, their, possible, interest, in, joining, the, east, coast, oceanographic, consortium, with, the, goal, of, developing, a, pipeline, of, underrepresented, students, at, gso, and, other, ecoc, institutions, in, an, effort, to, increase, the, diversity, of, future, oceanographers, program, surfo, is, committed, to, recruiting, students, from, underrepresented, groups, recruiting, at, hbcus, and, minority, serving, institutions, msis, attending, conferences, focused, on, scientists, from, underrepresented, groups, sacnas, and, forming, a, partnership, with, the, puerto, rico, louis, stokes, alliance, for, minority, participation, have, begun, to, effect, change, last, summer, half, of, our, surfo, student, participants, were, from, underrepresented, groups, we, look, forward, to, next, week, when, a, new, cohort, begins, with, almost, half, the, young, scientists, from, underrepresented, groups, these, efforts, do, not, address, the, inequities, and, injustices, that, presently, exist, with, structural, racism, in, america, but, are, examples, of, our, commitment, to, recruit, and, welcome, black, students, students, of, color, and, other, minorities, to, oceanography, with, the, goal, of, promoting, equity, within, the, science, community, this, is, the, time, to, address, questions, of, inequity, justice, and, the, rights, of, all, individuals, in, our, society, it, is, a, time, for, reflection, and, for, discussion, but, it, is, also, a, time, to, develop, and, execute, plans, to, address, these, issues, recognizing, that, the, scarcity, of, black, oceanographers, is, a, result, of, an, unjust, educational, system, a, key, goal, of, outreach, efforts, is, to, prioritize, access, for, underrepresented, communities, to, ocean, science, gso, will, continue, to, spark, partnerships, with, schools, throughout, rhode, island, and, minority, serving, institutions, across, the, country, we, are, emboldened, to, strengthen, these, efforts, as, part, of, that, effort, gso, will, help, make, meaningful, partnerships, with, minority, serving, institutions, within, the, east, coast, oceanographic, consortium, to, develop, opportunities, for, black, and, minority, students, this, summer, we, will, also, share, on, the, gso, website, opportunities, for, discussion, on, systemic, racism, offered, by, the, office, of, community, equity, and, diversity, there, have, been, many, thoughtful, statements, across, the, country, that, address, recent, disturbing, racist, acts, and, the, need, to, confront, racial, injustice, and, the, culture, that, fosters, it, i, would, like, to, share, one, by, sudip, ceo, of, the, aaas, that, is, an, insightful, statement, about, the, need, to, come, together, in, the, science, community, to, address, the, challenges, that, we, are, all, facing, gso, is, committed, to, moving, forward, in, a, thoughtful, and, meaningful, way, in, the, days, and, years, to, come, please, reach, out, to, me, and, other, gso, leaders, if, you, would, like, to, express, concerns, or, suggestions, sincerely, bruce, corliss, dean, uri, graduate, school, of, oceanography
