to, follow, up, my, statement, last, week, in, on, the, waterfront, should, you, not, have, had, the, opportunity, to, read, it, the, senseless, death, of, george, floyd, ha, created, despair, and, anger, across, the, country, and, a, the, uri, senior, leadership, team, stated, in, a, recent, email, is, a, reminder, of, the, oppression, and, injustice, still, too, prevalent, in, our, society, the, graduate, school, of, oceanography, and, the, university, of, rhode, island, are, committed, to, a, more, just, and, equitable, society, and, university, community, i, write, to, that, commitment, to, promote, and, respect, diversity, and, justice, for, all, within, our, campus, and, within, the, nation, a, we, struggle, to, address, systemic, problem, within, our, society, and, across, the, country, the, death, of, george, floyd, and, racism, together, with, a, lack, of, progress, to, address, the, root, of, these, crime, have, led, to, frustration, and, anger, generated, by, police, brutality, racial, injustice, and, a, culture, among, some, that, condones, violence, this, anger, is, also, based, on, societal, and, structural, racism, that, ha, pervaded, the, fabric, of, america, societal, racism, includes, inequality, in, distribution, availability, of, health, care, and, affordable, health, insurance, and, educational, opportunity, and, is, perpetuated, not, only, by, individual, and, institution, but, by, lawmaker, pass, legislation, that, precludes, or, limit, opportunity, to, minority, community, and, in, particular, to, black, american, politics, matter, these, societal, and, financial, inequity, have, existed, for, a, very, long, time, and, the, lack, of, progress, to, address, these, inequity, is, at, the, core, of, the, problem, that, the, country, face, today, gso, ha, actively, made, effort, to, attract, minority, faculty, and, student, in, general, and, specifically, african, american, to, join, gso, and, will, continue, to, do, so, in, addition, professional, society, have, fostered, and, reinforced, the, need, to, increase, underrepresented, minority, in, the, science, and, in, particular, black, american, but, clearly, we, a, an, institution, and, a, discipline, must, hold, ourselves, accountable, and, do, better, it, is, time, to, reflect, upon, and, then, redouble, our, effort, to, ensure, that, current, and, prospective, faculty, student, and, staff, of, color, feel, that, they, belong, and, are, supported, the, gso, faculty, voted, last, year, to, remove, the, gre, test, requirement, in, graduate,
