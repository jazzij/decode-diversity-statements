the, primary, role, of, police, in, america, is, to, provide, for, the, safety, of, all, people, by, protect, them, from, criminal, and, to, hold, each, of, u, accountable, to, the, law, we, expect, police, to, apprehend, criminal, and, work, within, the, legal, system, to, make, certain, that, justice, is, blind, and, all, are, held, accountable, to, the, law, we, all, have, watched, in, horror, video, be, replayed, over, the, past, week, show, the, life, of, george, floyd, brutally, taken, from, him, by, a, white, police, officer, in, minneapolis, while, three, other, officer, sworn, to, uphold, the, law, looked, on, in, indifference, the, officer, who, killed, floyd, wa, arrested, and, all, four, of, the, officer, were, fired, but, the, other, three, officer, simply, went, home, sadly, this, horrific, event, is, just, the, latest, in, a, seemingly, endless, stream, of, act, of, violence, against, black, and, other, people, of, color, by, police, who, are, sworn, to, protect, and, serve, them, death, come, on, the, heel, of, the, fatal, shoot, of, ahmaud, arbery, by, armed, white, resident, a, he, wa, out, jog, in, a, neighborhood, in, south, georgia, a, well, the, march, death, of, breonna, taylor, who, wa, shot, in, her, louisville, home, by, police, and, the, report, to, police, last, week, of, an, african, american, man, threaten, a, white, woman, when, in, fact, he, wa, in, new, york, central, park, to, watch, bird, and, simply, asked, her, to, keep, her, dog, on, a, leash, we, continually, hear, speech, and, testimonial, about, how, unacceptable, and, terrible, these, act, are, and, how, our, leader, feel, the, pain, of, the, black, community, yet, noth, change, much, and, we, act, a, if, these, horrific, event, are, singular, or, isolated, event, but, these, are, not, they, are, the, product, of, a, failed, justice, system, that, perpetuates, racism, in, america, and, too, often, a, culture, of, silence, within, police, force, that, protects, incompetent, and, hateful, people, simply, because, they, wear, the, badge, we, are, condemned, to, relive, these, tragedy, unless, we, make, real, change, a, priority, throughout, this, country, america, must, be, a, land, of, personal, and, equal, freedom, safety, and, opportunity, for, all, people, and, to, be, certain, the, police, exist, to, protect, u, from, predator, and, not, to, control, u, that, attitude, should, be, universal, in, this, country, regardless, of, who, we, are, where, we, live, or, what, we, look, like, but, how, can, we, expect, america, and, all, people, who, live, here, includ, community, of, color, to, thrive, in, the, midst, of, such, violence, and, injustice, how, many, time, must, we, write, the, same, message, express, our, outrage, and, hurt, share, our, thought, and, prayer, for, those, harmed, and, plead, for, an, end, to, injustice, how, many, act, of, discrimination, injury, and, death, must, occur, before, our, country, confronts, the, reality, of, the, lived, experience, of, people, of, color, in, our, society, all, of, this, must, stop, and, that, requires, action, not, speech, polic, is, a, local, function, but, our, system, of, polic, requires, systematic, change, across, the, country, on, monday, i, will, write, the, national, governor, association, and, urge, the, association, and, other, group, to, develop, rule, train, program, and, disciplinary, code, for, appropriate, polic, to, be, enforced, throughout, america, and, for, union, to, step, up, and, support, the, justice, system, in, weed, out, bad, officer, most, police, are, good, dedicated, and, hard, work, men, and, woman, who, risk, their, life, every, day, for, the, of, all, people, they, deserve, our, thanks, and, respect, and, they, should, not, be, subject, to, public, scorn, because, we, are, incapable, of, hold, some, police, accountable, to, the, law, of, our, country, and, community, simply, because, they, wear, a, badge, a, a, university, community, we, must, join, together, to, ensure, that, all, member, of, the, osu, community, student, faculty, staff, and, visitor, not, only, feel, welcomed, and, safe, but, experience, our, community, a, a, place, to, thrive, each, and, every, member, of, our, community, must, know, they, are, valued, that, they, belong, here, and, that, we, celebrate, the, rich, diversity, that, they, bring, to, oregon, state, university, we, should, not, tolerate, anyth, le, our, new, police, chief, edgar, rodriguez, understands, that, police, must, be, a, community, partner, that, provide, a, sense, of, safety, in, the, university, and, broader, community, a, we, hire, officer, for, our, police, force, the, office, of, institutional, diversity, will, continue, to, provide, train, to, osu, public, safety, officer, on, implicit, bias, foundation, of, power, privilege, and, oppression, to, ensure, that, our, public, safety, practice, are, congruent, with, value, regard, inclusivity, and, oppos, oppression, university, leader, also, will, to, seek, to, achieve, agreement, with, police, agency, in, community, where, osu, operates, so, that, we, may, mutually, advance, inclusive, justice, for, all, people, the, novel, coronavirus, pandemic, ha, made, all, of, u, look, at, the, inequity, in, our, society, we, call, people, essential, worker, and, yet, we, systematically, pay, them, le, than, live, wage, and, deny, them, critical, health, care, and, quality, education, for, themselves, and, their, child, and, we, act, surprised, that, they, are, disproportionately, vulnerable, to, death, from, the, pandemic, because, of, condition, and, that, they, are, disproportionately, people, of, color, when, do, we, get, disgusted, enough, with, what, we, have, created, and, say, enough, we, have, a, polic, problem, in, america, but, it, is, part, of, a, much, deeper, and, broader, failure, of, this, society, to, live, up, to, the, promise, of, america, which, continually, eludes, u, a, i, prepare, to, step, down, a, university, president, on, june, i, am, confident, that, our, university, and, the, osu, community, are, in, the, right, hand, with, incom, president, king, alexander, he, and, i, talk, often, and, i, know, he, share, my, personal, value, and, leadership, commitment, to, inclusivity, safety, and, opportunity, for, all, i, know, that, a, next, president, he, will, be, unwav, in, help, advance, the, work, of, inclusive, justice, and, opportunity, for, all, that, must, be, part, of, life, within, osu, and, across, america, together, with, chief, rodriguez, he, will, help, u, move, in, the, right, direction, in, our, little, part, of, the, world, in, close, i, ask, that, each, of, u, continue, to, participate, in, dialogue, leadership, and, understand, a, we, seek, to, alter, the, direction, of, society, i, know, this, will, not, happen, overnight, but, by, god, it, need, to, happen, soon
