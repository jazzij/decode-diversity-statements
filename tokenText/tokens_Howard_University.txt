recent, months, have, cast, a, long, shadow, as, the, pandemic, continues, its, deadly, toll, on, the, nation, ravaging, black, brown, and, native, american, communities, in, particular, and, in, the, midst, of, such, anguish, the, images, of, black, americans, treated, without, humanity, and, in, some, cases, brutalized, in, the, last, moments, of, their, earthly, lives, triggers, waves, of, emotion, including, staggering, grief, and, righteous, anger, this, constant, attack, on, the, black, experience, must, end, i, am, the, proud, father, of, two, precocious, teenagers, like, many, parents, we, have, very, purposely, had, the, talk, the, unwelcome, but, necessary, conversation, about, how, to, prepare, for, engagement, with, law, enforcement, watching, these, examples, of, social, injustice, and, unrest, in, the, presence, of, my, son, has, brought, up, some, difficult, conversations, he, reminded, me, of, a, time, when, we, were, heading, to, campus, and, were, pulled, over, i, personally, do, recall, all, the, details, of, that, stop, however, my, son, vividly, remembers, the, anger, he, felt, as, a, result, of, the, interaction, upon, seeing, the, news, out, of, minneapolis, he, turned, to, me, and, asked, dad, should, i, just, fall, to, the, ground, if, a, cop, approaches, me, praying, for, the, right, words, to, say, i, told, him, that, he, should, remain, calm, and, try, to, express, himself, to, the, best, of, his, ability, yet, even, after, struggling, through, that, conversation, the, myriad, names, of, innocent, black, lives, taken, through, lethal, force, young, and, old, men, and, women, testify, to, the, insufficiency, of, that, advice, this, moment, of, compounding, crises, leaves, little, doubt, that, the, daily, experience, of, so, many, in, our, community, remain, marked, by, heightened, vulnerability, and, a, likelihood, to, encounter, deadly, force, at, the, hands, of, misguided, individuals, or, those, whose, bigoted, views, betray, the, oaths, they, swore, to, protect, and, serve, howard, university, emerged, from, the, ashes, of, the, american, civil, war, a, conflict, that, raised, but, hardly, resolved, the, racial, divide, in, this, nation, firmly, rooted, in, a, promise, that, offered, the, transformative, power, of, education, to, all, howard, has, consistently, taught, that, the, highest, use, of, knowledge, gained, at, the, mecca, is, demonstrated, in, service, above, self, focused, on, addressing, systematic, injustices, and, entrenched, interests, antagonistic, to, our, enjoyment, of, life, and, liberty, our, scholars, have, enlightened, our, physicians, have, healed, our, lawyers, have, advocated, our, activists, have, agitated, our, entrepreneurs, have, built, our, counselors, have, comforted, and, our, artists, have, enriched, even, life, itself, our, nation, would, be, a, shadow, of, itself, and, remain, as, imperfect, as, it, was, at, its, inception, without, the, contributions, of, howard, university, and, all, it, stands, for, in, the, context, of, current, events, there, must, always, be, accountability, for, all, found, responsible, through, a, fair, and, thorough, investigation, so, that, justice, is, served, yet, even, as, we, see, individual, perpetrators, on, our, screens, we, must, remain, mindful, that, the, distorted, worldviews, and, ugly, biases, have, too, often, been, codified, into, inequitable, or, predatory, systems, are, equally, culpable, the, book, of, ephesians, reminds, us, for, we, wrestle, not, against, flesh, and, blood, but, against, principalities, against, powers, against, the, rulers, of, the, darkness, of, this, world, against, spiritual, wickedness, in, high, places, we, were, born, for, such, a, time, as, this, and, i, am, convinced, that, institutions, like, howard, university, are, destined, to, continue, to, build, mold, and, train, the, leaders, who, will, help, bring, needed, change, to, the, structures, of, our, society, no, pandemic, no, declining, economy, no, period, of, prosperity, and, no, cure, for, every, medical, ailment, will, undo, or, hide, the, realities, of, the, black, experience, we, must, bring, consistency, to, that, struggle, and, focus, our, intellect, and, passion, daily, to, prepare, for, the, hard, work, that, must, be, done, to, confront, evil, and, systematic, oppression, as, students, remain, vigilant, about, your, studies, you, are, matriculating, through, howard, university, for, a, purpose, that, is, greater, than, yourselves, you, are, the, hope, of, our, ancestors, and, despite, the, new, challenges, that, will, come, our, way, each, day, that, you, remain, resolved, to, focus, on, your, destiny, is, a, day, that, brings, us, closer, to, resolution, to, many, of, our, world, dilemmas, as, faculty, continue, to, focus, our, energies, and, concern, on, our, students, so, that, they, would, be, nurtured, thrive, and, excel, we, all, are, intricately, woven, into, the, fabric, of, the, howard, university, legacy, keep, researching, writing, and, speaking, out, to, craft, solutions, to, the, contemporary, challenges, we, face, we, must, be, diligent, in, our, work, and, conversations, with, students, to, hear, and, walk, with, them, through, these, trying, times, let, not, forget, that, we, are, all, living, these, experiences, in, our, daily, lives, outside, of, howard, it, is, everywhere, that, we, are, let, first, start, by, not, looking, past, each, other, wherever, we, may, be, and, work, on, actively, loving, each, other, in, this, moment, it, is, necessary, to, grieve, over, another, life, taken, unnecessarily, and, those, who, loved, him, who, are, now, broken, and, left, behind, to, mourn, it, okay, to, be, angry, it, okay, to, be, sad, it, okay, to, feel, numb, stay, there, as, long, as, you, need, to, i, encourage, you, to, take, those, feelings, and, channel, them, into, something, durable, write, about, it, sing, about, it, participate, in, the, electoral, process, and, vote, about, it, we, must, remember, the, names, of, george, floyd, ahmaud, arbery, atatiana, jefferson, breonna, taylor, and, the, countless, other, lives, gone, too, soon, we, can, honor, their, memories, through, a, life, of, purpose, in, confronting, and, correcting, those, skewed, systems, until, they, respect, the, humanity, and, inherent, dignity, in, each, of, us
