dear, washington, university, community, to, say, that, this, has, been, a, difficult, and, painful, week, would, be, an, extreme, understatement, like, you, i, watched, with, sadness, and, grief, as, events, have, unfolded, first, in, minneapolis, in, response, to, the, killing, of, george, floyd, and, then, across, the, country, as, individuals, and, communities, have, taken, to, the, streets, to, express, their, anger, and, frustration, at, the, racial, injustice, that, continues, to, plague, our, nation, the, ongoing, racial, violence, that, we, are, witnessing, against, people, of, color, is, nothing, short, of, devastating, in, recent, months, we, have, seen, a, rise, in, and, violence, largely, perpetuated, by, other, americans, in, the, last, two, weeks, we, have, seen, the, continuation, of, violence, against, black, americans, both, at, the, hands, of, officers, of, the, state, and, private, individuals, the, events, of, the, past, several, days, reflect, only, the, most, recent, in, a, long, line, of, wrongs, that, have, been, inflicted, upon, our, communities, of, color, here, in, louis, we, are, all, too, familiar, with, the, refrain, of, those, who, are, committed, to, addressing, issues, of, inequality, and, racism, no, justice, no, peace, given, our, commitment, to, activism, and, social, justice, it, no, surprise, that, the, louis, community, has, joined, the, call, to, action, and, i, heartened, to, see, the, passion, that, drives, our, friends, and, neighbors, to, make, their, voices, heard, i, also, am, deeply, concerned, for, the, of, our, community, and, remain, committed, to, working, toward, a, constructive, path, forward, in, our, region, that, tackles, structural, disparities, and, inequities, i, spent, a, lot, of, time, this, weekend, thinking, and, engaging, in, conversation, with, other, university, leaders, about, how, we, can, best, support, our, community, and, advance, the, cause, of, racial, justice, during, this, time, what, we, could, say, or, do, that, would, bring, comfort, to, those, who, are, hurting, and, show, solidarity, with, those, who, are, taking, action, given, the, enormity, of, the, issues, before, us, we, know, without, question, that, words, are, not, enough, and, that, no, statement, will, begin, to, resolve, the, tremendous, challenges, that, are, still, before, us, and, yet, there, are, some, things, that, are, important, to, say, first, we, must, acknowledge, those, who, are, suffering, to, our, students, faculty, staff, and, any, other, members, of, our, community, who, are, feeling, targeted, unheard, or, unsupported, we, see, you, and, are, here, for, you, our, commitment, to, diversity, and, inclusion, means, more, than, just, welcoming, every, person, into, our, community, it, means, valuing, you, as, individuals, with, your, own, identities, actively, acknowledging, that, you, matter, and, unwaveringly, supporting, your, right, to, be, treated, fairly, and, equally, in, every, aspect, of, our, society, we, stand, with, you, and, condemn, all, acts, of, hate, aggression, or, disrespect, toward, any, racial, group, that, may, happen, anywhere, in, our, community, our, region, our, country, or, the, world, we, are, committed, to, supporting, all, members, of, our, community, and, we, must, redouble, our, efforts, to, achieve, the, equity, that, is, foundational, to, fostering, this, environment, in, addition, we, remain, committed, to, making, a, difference, after, the, killing, of, michael, brown, in, ferguson, in, our, washington, university, community, began, the, long, process, of, looking, inward, to, see, how, we, could, create, space, for, honest, dialogue, about, race, ethnicity, inequality, and, social, justice, how, we, could, do, better, and, be, better, since, that, time, we, have, taken, steps, as, a, community, to, become, more, fully, engaged, on, these, issues, and, to, work, toward, positive, change, at, our, most, recent, day, of, dialogue, and, action, this, spring, we, reaffirmed, our, commitment, to, creating, intentional, spaces, to, listen, extend, empathy, celebrate, and, engage, in, dialogue, in, hopes, of, reflecting, on, our, own, humanity, and, the, humanity, of, others, the, events, of, this, week, are, a, painful, reminder, of, how, much, work, we, all, still, have, to, do, as, a, nation, and, as, a, society, finally, we, must, take, action, this, includes, not, only, supporting, our, community, but, also, doing, what, is, at, the, core, of, our, mission, leveraging, our, activities, in, support, of, research, teaching, and, patient, care, to, make, a, difference, in, helping, to, forward, the, cause, of, racial, and, social, justice, in, our, community, our, region, and, around, the, world, already, some, of, our, schools, have, announced, initiatives, aimed, at, improving, racial, equity, especially, focusing, on, racial, violence, we, anticipate, announcing, additional, initiatives, in, the, coming, weeks, the, separation, of, our, community, due, to, the, pandemic, has, placed, an, additional, strain, on, our, ability, to, come, together, to, support, listen, to, and, learn, from, one, another, we, are, all, struggling, with, the, disconnection, from, our, peers, friends, and, support, networks, especially, during, this, time, of, additional, stress, but, this, only, makes, our, need, to, create, space, for, engagement, within, our, community, even, more, urgent, and, we, are, working, toward, ways, to, do, that, in, the, days, ahead, in, the, please, stay, tuned, for, invitations, to, opportunities, to, participate, in, observances, and, events, that, our, leaders, are, currently, planning, in, the, we, continue, to, listen, and, engage, with, members, of, our, community, to, work, toward, substantive, action, that, we, will, take, institutionally, to, make, our, city, and, our, world, beacons, of, opportunity, for, all, in, these, incredibly, difficult, times, i, know, there, are, no, words, that, will, be, enough, but, it, important, for, you, to, know, that, as, a, community, we, are, united, in, our, commitment, to, justice, and, racial, equity, sincerely, andrew, martin, chancellor
