protests, began, around, the, country, and, across, new, york, convulsing, the, city, yesterday, hundreds, if, not, thousands, of, new, yorkers, gathered, in, brooklyn, and, then, marched, across, the, brooklyn, bridge, past, one, pace, plaza, in, a, moving, commemoration, of, floyd, life, we, join, in, mourning, his, loss, during, this, time, we, have, been, listening, to, the, pace, community, and, hearing, the, pain, anguish, and, anger, we, are, reflecting, on, our, commitments, talking, with, our, student, government, associations, and, black, student, unions, and, determining, how, we, can, move, the, university, forward, while, doing, more, to, fight, for, equality, and, justice, we, know, we, have, always, gotten, it, right, and, we, want, to, do, better, we, recognize, that, floyd, death, is, not, an, isolated, case, it, has, been, three, and, a, half, months, since, ahmaud, arbery, was, shot, and, killed, while, out, for, a, jog, nearly, three, months,

guidance, of, the, chief, diversity, officer, in, partnership, with, other, campus, leaders, and, guided, by, the, findings, of, the, forthcoming, diversity, climate, survey, the, presidential, task,

task, force, will, be, formulated, in, the, coming, weeks, and, will, issue, its, recommendations, by, the, end, of, fall, semester, we, recognize, that, voices, need, to, be, heard, and, action, needs, to, happen, everywhere, across, the, university, and, we, ask, departments, and, divisions, to, review, their, areas, to, develop, commitments, for, systemic, change, these, recommendations,

members, of, the, pace, community, can, register, incidents, or, experiences, contradictory, to, the, inclusive, environment, we, seek, to, sustain, this, site, will, launch, during, fall, semester, whether, reported, on, this, site, or, elsewhere, university, leaders, will, always, investigate, and, respond, to, incidents, that, are, brought, to, our, attention, in, the, next, week, we, will, organize, a, community, forum, modeled, on, this, week, session, for, faculty, and, staff, in, which, all, members, of, the, pace, community, will, be, invited, to, share, their, experiences, and, their, visions, for, how, pace, can, make, a, difference, we, will, design, a, comprehensive, series, of, programming, for, the, fall, semester, to, examine, racial, justice, in, our, community, and, our, country, including, honoring, the, memory, of, dj, henry, as, we, mark, years, since, his, murder, we, welcome, all, in, the, pace, community, who, wish, to, serve, on, the, presidential, task,
