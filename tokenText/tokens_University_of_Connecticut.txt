deeply, personal, level, with, the, burden, of, fear, for, one, own, and, their, family, safety, placed, squarely, upon, unfortunately, this, is, just, one, of, many, example, of, the, pain, caused, by, systemic, injustice, that, are, present, every, day, take, for, example, the, disproportionate, rate, of, death, by, among, latinx, and, indigenous, people, or, the, discriminatory, act, target,

we, are, uniquely, positioned, to, reflect, learn, and, act, we, are, committed, to, this, work, a, uconn, move, forward, from, some, of, it, own, recent, struggle, we, have, a, crucial, new, partner, in, these, effort, with, the, recent, hire, of, frank, tuitt, a, our, new, vice, president, and, chief, diversity, officer, we, are, all, eager, to, work, with, him, to, sustain, a, culture, that,

health, and, overall, satisfaction, with, their, work, experience, this, is, a, time, when, we, can, build, momentum, to, share, the, responsibility, across, our, entire, community, at, our, storrs,

at, our, university, of, all, of, the, various, part, of, our, experience, a, administrator, this, is, the, one, area, where, we, both, feel, like, we, have, not, done, enough, or, met, our, own, expectation, we, do, not, experience, that, feel, a, despair, but, instead, a, a, motivator, to, understand, and, accept, our, own, privilege, and, the, responsibility, that, it, brings, to, do, more, we, encourage, our, community, to, hold, our, entire, leadership, team, accountable, a, we, carry, out, that, vital, work, together, the, challenge, now, is, to, remember, this, moment, even, if, it,
