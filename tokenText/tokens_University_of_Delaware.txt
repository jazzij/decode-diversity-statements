a, university, community, and, we, will, do, it, together, over, the, past, several, days, many, of, you, have, written, to, me, or, posted, your, thoughts, on, social, media, to, express, your, anger, and, frustration, about, the, racial, injustices, that, have, been, laid, bare, by, the, social, unrest, taking, place, in, our, nation, more, i, have, been, truly, heartbroken, to, hear, the, stories, of, discrimination, and, prejudice, that, many, of, you, have, experienced, whether, in, our, broader, society, or, unfortunately, here, within, our, own, community, it, is, so, disturbing, to, see, that, some, individuals, do, not, grasp, the, insidious, nature, of, racism, and, the, very, real, pain, caused, by, offensive, and, exclusionary, language, every, member, of, our, community, students, faculty, and, staff, is, welcomed, and, valued, at, the, university, of, delaware, we, must, ensure, that, everyone, is, treated, with, respect, and, a, sense, of, belonging, we, should, seek, to, find, commonality, humanity, and, civility, to, bridge, our, differences, we, condemn, the, discriminatory, and, inflammatory, words, used, by, some, members, of, our, community, they, do, not, reflect, the, values, we, are, addressing, each, of, these, situations, in, accordance, with, the, conduct, and, policies, last, week, the, nationwide, protests, began, as, a, response, to, the, senseless, deaths, of, george, floyd, in, minneapolis, ahmaud, arbery, in, georgia, and, breonna, taylor, in, kentucky, as, well, as, the, long, list, of, other, victims, of, discrimination, and, violence, in, american, history, the, global, consciousness, that, has, been, reawakened, by, these, tragedies, must, continue, to, advance, our, progress, toward, a, society, that, is, and, education, lies, at, the, heart, of, this, effort, and, is, the, key, to, real, and, lasting, change, without, a, doubt, the, university, of, delaware, can, and, must, do, more, to, expand, diversity, and, promote, inclusion, and, equity, in, our, community, since, coming, to, ud, i, have, tried, to, face, the, challenges, of, history, and, culture, that, i, see, indeed, building, inclusive, excellence, has, always, been, personally, important, to, me, while, we, have, made, strides, in, diversifying, our, faculty, ranks, and, our, student, enrollment, there, is, clearly, additional, work, to, be, done, i, am, committed, as, is, my, administration, to, redoubling, our, efforts, to, increase, minority, representation, among, our, students, faculty, and, staff, but, we, know, that, the, numbers, are, just, one, component, of, the, equation, we, must, work, ever, harder, to, promote, a, more, inclusive, culture, throughout, ud, where, everyone, is, valued, and, all, can, expand, their, potential, and, believe, in, a, better, future, to, this, end, i, will, be, working, closely, with, campus, leaders, to, ensure, progress, and, action, around, key, needs, of, the, university, recognizing, that, these, are, both, priorities, and, opportunities, to, take, ud, forward, we, all, need, to, take, the, following, steps, we, need, to, build, a, more, inclusive, culture, through, education, for, all, members, of, our, community, we, can, cultivate, a, greater, appreciation, of, the, value, of, diverse, peoples, cultures, and, perspectives, this, is, absolutely, essential, in, modern, society, and, directly, supports, our, institutional, mission, to, prepare, our, citizens, to, succeed, this, semester, we, piloted, an, online, diversity, equity, and, inclusion, education, module, we, will, plan, to, require, this, training, of, all, undergraduate, and, graduate, students, beginning, in, this, upcoming, academic, year, we, need, to, listen, and, learn, we, are, planning, a, series, of, forums, that, will, span, the, entire, next, academic, year, where, all, members, of, our, community, will, have, their, voices, heard, and, acknowledged, the, input, gathered, at, these, forums, will, help, inform, our, next, steps, as, we, continue, to, improve, our, campus, climate, with, actionable, initiatives, we, are, also, mindful, of, those, who, have, been, silent, and, we, encourage, them, to, come, forward, and, share, their, stories, perspectives, and, ideas, we, need, to, act, now, we, will, strengthen, our, collective, awareness, of, and, response, to, prejudice, diligently, recruit, underrepresented, faculty, and, students, and, raise, funds, for, social, justice, initiatives, on, campus, we, will, also, connect, our, efforts, and, networks, into, a, more, robust, agenda, for, larger, impact, we, need, to, ensure, accountability, and, operate, effectively, together, as, a, united, community, everyone, is, responsible, and, this, needs, to, be, enforced, through, renewed, policies, and, practices, using, a, framework, where, differences, are, respected, and, celebrated, we, must, also, ensure, that, our, campus, climate, and, culture, assessments, are, frequent, and, thorough, and, that, they, reaffirm, our, commitment, to, improve, the, diversity, and, inclusion, landscape, at, ud, we, have, more, to, do, this, list, is,
