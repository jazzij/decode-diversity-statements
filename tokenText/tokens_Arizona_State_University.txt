so, here, we, are, in, painfully, and, acutely, realiz, that, the, ideal, of, our, nation, a, embodied, in, the, constitution, aspiration, of, the, right, to, equal, justice, the, right, to, pursue, happiness, and, the, right, to, individual, liberty, are, in, fact, unfairly, and, inequitably, distributed, across, our, society, this, of, course, ha, been, a, reality, since, the, found, of, our, republic, and, although, we, have, made, progress, through, our, struggle, and, our, change, it, is, nonetheless, jolt, to, see, these, inequality, manifested, through, the, unfair, treatment, of, individual, based, on, their, race, and, ethnicity, by, the, very, government, designed, to, protect, and, defend, their, right, a, citizen, the, blatant, abuse, of, power, by, the, police, a, exhibited, in, the, case, of, george, floyd, and, many, others, is, in, many, way, akin, to, the, actual, abuse, of, power, perpetrated, against, american, in, way, that, led, to, the, revolution, against, great, britain, the, very, found, of, our, nation, wa, a, result, of, these, mistreatment, by, the, rule, government, itself, at, the, time, individual, have, right, the, government, must, protect, those, right, and, the, government, must, not, be, involved, in, injur, or, diminish, those, right, particularly, in, it, exertion, of, power, towards, it, people, the, constitution, of, the, united, state, is, perhaps, the, most, important, aspirational, document, ever, written, and, codified, by, human, to, govern, themselves, particularly, in, the, sense, that, it, leaf, very, little, to, doubt, about, it, goal, of, equality, justice, liberty, and, the, ability, to, pursue, happiness, by, the, individual, a, it, purpose, that, document, the, constitution, is, in, and, of, itself, our, collective, aspirational, goal, the, society, we, wish, we, could, be, a, a, people, can, we, find, way, in, all, that, we, do, includ, polic, education, and, social, welfare, to, meet, the, ideal, of, that, constitution, and, all, that, it, stand, for, the, answer, is, no, unless, we, are, will, to, face, our, failing, call, out, our, injustice, and, drive, towards, the, change, needed, to, achieve, the, common, goal, america, wa, built, to, achieve, in, august, on, the, step, of, the, lincoln, memorial, the, reverend, martin, luther, king, in, his, globally, noted, and, socially, profound, i, have, a, dream, speech, outlined, exactly, this, concept, of, aspiration, king, used, the, dream, concept, to, describe, a, world, in, the, future, in, which, the, actual, articulation, of, the, aspiration, of, the, constitution, could, be, realized, in, every, person, life, regardless, of, their, race, ethnicity, religion, or, social, class, he, did, this, with, a, level, of, eloquent, intensity, that, set, the, stage, for, the, pursuit, of, further, attainment, of, the, american, constitutional, aspiration, he, knew, the, aspiration, he, knew, the, intent, of, the, word, and, the, concept, he, knew, the, philosophy, on, which, they, were, based, and, that, they, were, substantial, and, powerful, in, term, of, what, is, a, human, be, he, knew, the, struggle, that, preceded, in, the, evolution, of, the, united, state, and, he, knew, the, struggle, that, he, wa, a, part, of, a, a, leader, of, the, civil, right, movement, in, the, which, ultimately, cost, him, his, own, life, the, key, point, here, by, king, and, i, think, the, key, point, of, the, constitution, itself, go, well, beyond, any, interpretation, of, the, constitution, by, a, particular, sit, supreme, court, for, a, we, know, many, of, those, interpretation, from, the, past, would, be, found, today, to, be, appal, but, rather, towards, the, idea, of, fight, for, and, drive, toward, and, work, toward, our, national, aspirational, goal, particularly, of, equality, and, justice, we, the, university, community, broadly, and, arizona, state, university, specifically, are, in, fact, an, aspirational, institution, and, we, have, in, fact, been, woefully, inadequate, up, to, this, point, in, our, own, effort, to, facilitate, the, mean, by, which, higher, aspirational, attainment, might, be, achieved, for, these, central, goal, to, our, society, this, is, particularly, true, a, we, have, grown, and, diversified, a, a, society, at, asu, we, have, taken, to, heart, the, notion, of, design, and, build, the, new, american, university, a, university, built, on, the, notion, of, maximum, social, inclusion, maximum, academic, excellence, and, maximum, impact, on, serv, our, community, all, from, the, same, institution, in, the, last, year, arizona, state, university, student, have, become, representative, of, the, totality, of, the, diversity, of, our, society, and, we, have, altered, the, functional, way, in, which, we, operate, to, help, bring, about, this, new, america, this, aspirational, attainment, of, our, core, value, a, stated, through, the, constitution, but, even, with, that, we, have, been, too, slow, in, the, concept, of, redesign, reconceptu, restaf, and, enabl, the, institution, that, we, the, university, more, broadly, and, asu, more, specifically, have, helped, to, design, create, staff, and, ass, our, institution, are, not, live, up, to, our, hope, they, are, not, yet, a, capable, a, they, need, to, be, to, reach, our, collective, dream, why, is, it, that, we, still, have, system, and, institution, that, can, carry, out, and, often, justify, injustice, in, the, name, of, the, people, why, is, it, that, we, have, inadequate, learn, and, empowerment, opportunity, in, so, many, area, of, our, society, why, do, we, have, police, officer, so, inadequately, trained, that, group, of, them, can, stand, by, while, a, person, is, murdered, in, a, public, display, of, abuse, of, authority, why, do, we, not, have, enough, new, tool, for, enhanc, the, outcome, of, our, criminal, justice, system, or, enough, new, idea, and, solution, about, how, to, address, drug, addiction, and, other, powerfully, negative, force, at, work, in, our, society, why, have, university, become, increasingly, elitist, organization, draw, only, from, the, cream, of, the, cream, of, our, society, or, from, family, produc, learn, elite, from, significant, amount, of, personal, wealth, and, personal, network, these, and, many, other, question, are, question, that, we, can, and, should, not, only, address, but, attack, and, begin, to, resolve, but, in, spite, of, all, of, our, effort, we, still, have, insufficient, idea, for, social, transformation, where, it, might, make, the, most, positive, difference, in, term, of, acceler, the, rate, of, change, and, acceler, the, rate, of, enhanced, social, justice, and, acceler, the, rate, of, enhanced, pursuit, of, happiness, across, a, much, of, our, society, a, is, possible, we, need, to, do, more, to, do, more, i, am, ask, our, dean, and, faculty, and, student, of, all, of, our, asu, college, to, outline, new, initiative, new, program, and, new, design, that, we, can, initiate, with, our, own, resource, and, then, pursue, additional, partner, in, creat, and, deploy, new, solution, our, watt, college, of, public, service, and, community, solution, our, sandra, day, college, of, law, our, school, of, social, transformation, our, mary, lou, fulton, teacher, college, and, other, critical, asu, academic, community, can, outline, new, effort, new, concept, and, new, strategy, to, devise, new, model, for, protect, and, defend, the, right, of, individual, new, method, new, concept, and, new, tool, for, polic, model, for, justice, and, the, law, that, are, in, fact, implementable, throughout, the, process, and, not, only, after, injustice, have, occurred, all, of, our, school, and, all, of, our, program, a, well, a, all, of, our, faculty, can, engage, in, this, process, of, new, idea, new, design, and, new, concept, while, we, a, arizona, state, university, continue, to, strive, towards, our, aspirational, goal, of, be, the, highest, quality, highest, perform, most, egalitarian, university, oper, across, the, breadth, of, our, society, that, we, possibly, can, be, to, do, this, i, am, ask, that, the, dean, engage, in, a, process, and, that, the, student, leader, also, engage, in, a, process, for, specific, new, initiative, that, we, can, undertake, i, would, like, to, be, able, to, review, these, aspirational, attainment, idea, before, the, open, of, the, fall, semester, so, that, we, might, get, some, new, energy, focused, here, a, faculty, and, student, reassemble, if, in, the, interim, there, are, immediate, idea, or, immediate, action, get, those, to, me, straightaway, my, hope, is, that, we, can, take, a, good, hard, look, at, our, own, intellectual, underpinnings, here, and, ask, ourselves, are, there, thing, that, we, can, do, differently, or, design, that, we, can, produce, or, teach, and, learn, that, we, can, alter, that, can, help, produce, new, and, better, aspirational, attainment, for, the, goal, of, our, country, i, look, forward, to, our, move, forward, a, soon, a, possible, with, new, effort
