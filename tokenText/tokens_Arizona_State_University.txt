so, here, we, are, in, painfully, and, acutely, realizing, that, the, ideals, of, our, nation, as, embodied, in, the, constitution, aspirations, of, the, right, to, equal, justice, the, right, to, pursue, happiness, and, the, right, to, individual, liberty, are, in, fact, unfairly, and, inequitably, distributed, across, our, society, this, of, course, has, been, a, reality, since, the, founding, of, our, republic, and, although, we, have, made, progress, through, our, struggles, and, our, changes, it, is, nonetheless, jolting, to, see, these, inequalities, manifested, through, the, unfair, treatment, of, individuals, based, on, their, race, and, ethnicity, by, the, very, government, designed, to, protect, and, defend, their, rights, as, citizens, the, blatant, abuse, of, power, by, the, police, as, exhibited, in, the, case, of, george, floyd, and, many, others, is, in, many, ways, akin, to, the, actual, abuses, of, power, perpetrated, against, americans, in, ways, that, led, to, the, revolution, against, great, britain, the, very, founding, of, our, nation, was, a, result, of, these, mistreatments, by, the, ruling, government, itself, at, the, time, individuals, have, rights, the, government, must, protect, those, rights, and, the, government, must, not, be, involved, in, injuring, or, diminishing, those, rights, particularly, in, its, exertion, of, power, towards, its, people, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, is, perhaps, the, most, important, aspirational, document, ever, written, and, codified, by, humans, to, govern, themselves, particularly, in, the, sense, that, it, leaves, very, little, to, doubt, about, its, goals, of, equality, justice, liberty, and, the, ability, to, pursue, happiness, by, the, individual, as, its, purpose, that, document, the, constitution, is, in, and, of, itself, our, collective, aspirational, goal, the, society, we, wish, we, could, be, as, a, people, can, we, find, ways, in, all, that, we, do, including, policing, education, and, social, welfare, to, meet, the, ideals, of, that, constitution, and, all, that, it, stands, for, the, answer, is, no, unless, we, are, willing, to, face, our, failings, call, out, our, injustices, and, drive, towards, the, changes, needed, to, achieve, the, common, goals, america, was, built, to, achieve, in, august, on, the, steps, of, the, lincoln, memorial, the, reverend, martin, luther, king, in, his, globally, noted, and, socially, profound, i, have, a, dream, speech, outlined, exactly, this, concept, of, aspiration, king, used, the, dream, concept, to, describe, a, world, in, the, future, in, which, the, actual, articulation, of, the, aspirations, of, the, constitution, could, be, realized, in, every, person, life, regardless, of, their, race, ethnicity, religion, or, social, class, he, did, this, with, a, level, of, eloquent, intensity, that, set, the, stage, for, the, pursuit, of, further, attainment, of, the, american, constitutional, aspirations, he, knew, the, aspirations, he, knew, the, intent, of, the, words, and, the, concepts, he, knew, the, philosophies, on, which, they, were, based, and, that, they, were, substantial, and, powerful, in, terms, of, what, is, a, human, being, he, knew, the, struggles, that, preceded, in, the, evolution, of, the, united, states, and, he, knew, the, struggle, that, he, was, a, part, of, as, a, leader, of, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, which, ultimately, cost, him, his, own, life, the, key, point, here, by, king, and, i, think, the, key, point, of, the, constitution, itself, goes, well, beyond, any, interpretation, of, the, constitution, by, a, particular, sitting, supreme, court, for, as, we, know, many, of, those, interpretations, from, the, past, would, be, found, today, to, be, appalling, but, rather, towards, the, idea, of, fighting, for, and, driving, toward, and, working, toward, our, national, aspirational, goals, particularly, of, equality, and, justice, we, the, university, community, broadly, and, arizona, state, university, specifically, are, in, fact, an, aspirational, institution, and, we, have, in, fact, been, woefully, inadequate, up, to, this, point, in, our, own, efforts, to, facilitate, the, means, by, which, higher, aspirational, attainment, might, be, achieved, for, these, central, goals, to, our, society, this, is, particularly, true, as, we, have, grown, and, diversified, as, a, society, at, asu, we, have, taken, to, heart, the, notion, of, designing, and, building, the, new, american, university, a, university, built, on, the, notion, of, maximum, social, inclusion, maximum, academic, excellence, and, maximum, impact, on, serving, our, communities, all, from, the, same, institution, in, the, last, years, arizona, state, university, students, have, become, representative, of, the, totality, of, the, diversity, of, our, society, and, we, have, altered, the, functional, way, in, which, we, operate, to, help, bring, about, this, new, america, this, aspirational, attainment, of, our, core, values, as, stated, through, the, constitution, but, even, with, that, we, have, been, too, slow, in, the, concept, of, redesigning, reconceptualizing, restaffing, and, enabling, the, institutions, that, we, the, university, more, broadly, and, asu, more, specifically, have, helped, to, design, create, staff, and, assess, our, institutions, are, not, living, up, to, our, hopes, they, are, not, yet, as, capable, as, they, need, to, be, to, reach, our, collective, dream, why, is, it, that, we, still, have, systems, and, institutions, that, can, carry, out, and, often, justify, injustices, in, the, name, of, the, people, why, is, it, that, we, have, inadequate, learning, and, empowerment, opportunities, in, so, many, areas, of, our, society, why, do, we, have, police, officers, so, inadequately, trained, that, groups, of, them, can, stand, by, while, a, person, is, murdered, in, a, public, display, of, abuse, of, authority, why, do, we, not, have, enough, new, tools, for, enhancing, the, outcomes, of, our, criminal, justice, system, or, enough, new, ideas, and, solutions, about, how, to, address, drug, addiction, and, other, powerfully, negative, forces, at, work, in, our, society, why, have, universities, become, increasingly, elitist, organizations, drawing, only, from, the, cream, of, the, cream, of, our, society, or, from, families, producing, learning, elites, from, significant, amounts, of, personal, wealth, and, personal, networks, these, and, many, other, questions, are, questions, that, we, can, and, should, not, only, address, but, attack, and, begin, to, resolve, but, in, spite, of, all, of, our, efforts, we, still, have, insufficient, ideas, for, social, transformation, where, it, might, make, the, most, positive, difference, in, terms, of, accelerating, the, rate, of, change, and, accelerating, the, rate, of, enhanced, social, justice, and, accelerating, the, rate, of, enhanced, pursuit, of, happiness, across, as, much, of, our, society, as, is, possible, we, need, to, do, more, to, do, more, i, am, asking, our, deans, and, faculty, and, students, of, all, of, our, asu, colleges, to, outline, new, initiatives, new, programs, and, new, designs, that, we, can, initiate, with, our, own, resources, and, then, pursue, additional, partners, in, creating, and, deploying, new, solutions, our, watts, college, of, public, service, and, community, solutions, our, sandra, day, college, of, law, our, school, of, social, transformation, our, mary, lou, fulton, teachers, college, and, other, critical, asu, academic, communities, can, outline, new, efforts, new, concepts, and, new, strategies, to, devise, new, models, for, protecting, and, defending, the, rights, of, individuals, new, methods, new, concepts, and, new, tools, for, policing, models, for, justice, and, the, law, that, are, in, fact, implementable, throughout, the, process, and, not, only, after, injustices, have, occurred, all, of, our, schools, and, all, of, our, programs, as, well, as, all, of, our, faculty, can, engage, in, this, process, of, new, ideas, new, designs, and, new, concepts, while, we, as, arizona, state, university, continue, to, strive, towards, our, aspirational, goal, of, being, the, highest, quality, highest, performing, most, egalitarian, university, operating, across, the, breadth, of, our, society, that, we, possibly, can, be, to, do, this, i, am, asking, that, the, deans, engage, in, a, process, and, that, the, student, leaders, also, engage, in, a, process, for, specific, new, initiatives, that, we, can, undertake, i, would, like, to, be, able, to, review, these, aspirational, attainment, ideas, before, the, opening, of, the, fall, semester, so, that, we, might, get, some, new, energy, focused, here, as, faculty, and, students, reassemble, if, in, the, interim, there, are, immediate, ideas, or, immediate, actions, get, those, to, me, straightaway, my, hope, is, that, we, can, take, a, good, hard, look, at, our, own, intellectual, underpinnings, here, and, ask, ourselves, are, there, things, that, we, can, do, differently, or, designs, that, we, can, produce, or, teaching, and, learning, that, we, can, alter, that, can, help, produce, new, and, better, aspirational, attainment, for, the, goals, of, our, country, i, look, forward, to, our, moving, forward, as, soon, as, possible, with, new, efforts
