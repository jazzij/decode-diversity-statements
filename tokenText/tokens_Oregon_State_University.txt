the, primary, role, of, police, in, america, is, to, provide, for, the, safety, of, all, people, by, protecting, them, from, criminals, and, to, hold, each, of, us, accountable, to, the, law, we, expect, police, to, apprehend, criminals, and, work, within, the, legal, system, to, make, certain, that, justice, is, blind, and, all, are, held, accountable, to, the, law, we, all, have, watched, in, horror, videos, being, replayed, over, the, past, week, showing, the, life, of, george, floyd, brutally, taken, from, him, by, a, white, police, officer, in, minneapolis, while, three, other, officers, sworn, to, uphold, the, law, looked, on, in, indifference, the, officer, who, killed, floyd, was, arrested, and, all, four, of, the, officers, were, fired, but, the, other, three, officers, simply, went, home, sadly, this, horrific, event, is, just, the, latest, in, a, seemingly, endless, stream, of, acts, of, violence, against, black, and, other, people, of, color, by, police, who, are, sworn, to, protect, and, serve, them, death, comes, on, the, heels, of, the, fatal, shooting, of, ahmaud, arbery, by, armed, white, residents, as, he, was, out, jogging, in, a, neighborhood, in, south, georgia, as, well, the, march, death, of, breonna, taylor, who, was, shot, in, her, louisville, home, by, police, and, the, reporting, to, police, last, week, of, an, african, american, man, threatening, a, white, woman, when, in, fact, he, was, in, new, york, central, park, to, watch, birds, and, simply, asked, her, to, keep, her, dog, on, a, leash, we, continually, hear, speeches, and, testimonials, about, how, unacceptable, and, terrible, these, acts, are, and, how, our, leaders, feel, the, pain, of, the, black, community, yet, nothing, changes, much, and, we, act, as, if, these, horrific, events, are, singular, or, isolated, events, but, these, are, not, they, are, the, product, of, a, failed, justice, system, that, perpetuates, racism, in, america, and, too, often, a, culture, of, silence, within, police, forces, that, protects, incompetent, and, hateful, people, simply, because, they, wear, the, badge, we, are, condemned, to, relive, these, tragedies, unless, we, make, real, change, a, priority, throughout, this, country, america, must, be, a, land, of, personal, and, equal, freedom, safety, and, opportunity, for, all, people, and, to, be, certain, the, police, exist, to, protect, us, from, predators, and, not, to, control, us, that, attitude, should, be, universal, in, this, country, regardless, of, who, we, are, where, we, live, or, what, we, look, like, but, how, can, we, expect, america, and, all, people, who, live, here, including, communities, of, color, to, thrive, in, the, midst, of, such, violence, and, injustice, how, many, times, must, we, write, the, same, messages, expressing, our, outrage, and, hurt, sharing, our, thoughts, and, prayers, for, those, harmed, and, pleading, for, an, end, to, injustice, how, many, acts, of, discrimination, injury, and, death, must, occur, before, our, country, confronts, the, realities, of, the, lived, experiences, of, people, of, color, in, our, society, all, of, this, must, stop, and, that, requires, action, not, speeches, policing, is, a, local, function, but, our, system, of, policing, requires, systematic, change, across, the, country, on, monday, i, will, write, the, national, governors, association, and, urge, the, association, and, other, groups, to, develop, rules, training, programs, and, disciplinary, codes, for, appropriate, policing, to, be, enforced, throughout, america, and, for, unions, to, step, up, and, support, the, justice, system, in, weeding, out, bad, officers, most, police, are, good, dedicated, and, hard, working, men, and, women, who, risk, their, lives, every, day, for, the, of, all, people, they, deserve, our, thanks, and, respect, and, they, should, not, be, subject, to, public, scorn, because, we, are, incapable, of, holding, some, police, accountable, to, the, laws, of, our, country, and, communities, simply, because, they, wear, a, badge, as, a, university, community, we, must, join, together, to, ensure, that, all, members, of, the, osu, community, students, faculty, staff, and, visitors, not, only, feel, welcomed, and, safe, but, experience, our, community, as, a, place, to, thrive, each, and, every, member, of, our, community, must, know, they, are, valued, that, they, belong, here, and, that, we, celebrate, the, rich, diversity, that, they, bring, to, oregon, state, university, we, should, not, tolerate, anything, less, our, new, police, chief, edgar, rodriguez, understands, that, police, must, be, a, community, partner, that, provide, a, sense, of, safety, in, the, university, and, broader, community, as, we, hire, officers, for, our, police, force, the, office, of, institutional, diversity, will, continue, to, provide, training, to, osu, public, safety, officers, on, implicit, bias, foundations, of, power, privilege, and, oppression, to, ensure, that, our, public, safety, practices, are, congruent, with, values, regarding, inclusivity, and, opposing, oppression, university, leaders, also, will, to, seek, to, achieve, agreements, with, police, agencies, in, communities, where, osu, operates, so, that, we, may, mutually, advance, inclusive, justice, for, all, people, the, novel, coronavirus, pandemic, has, made, all, of, us, look, at, the, inequities, in, our, society, we, call, people, essential, workers, and, yet, we, systematically, pay, them, less, than, living, wages, and, deny, them, critical, health, care, and, quality, education, for, themselves, and, their, children, and, we, act, surprised, that, they, are, disproportionately, vulnerable, to, death, from, the, pandemic, because, of, conditions, and, that, they, are, disproportionately, people, of, color, when, do, we, get, disgusted, enough, with, what, we, have, created, and, say, enough, we, have, a, policing, problem, in, america, but, it, is, part, of, a, much, deeper, and, broader, failure, of, this, society, to, live, up, to, the, promise, of, america, which, continually, eludes, us, as, i, prepare, to, step, down, as, university, president, on, june, i, am, confident, that, our, university, and, the, osu, community, are, in, the, right, hands, with, incoming, president, king, alexander, he, and, i, talk, often, and, i, know, he, shares, my, personal, values, and, leadership, commitment, to, inclusivity, safety, and, opportunity, for, all, i, know, that, as, next, president, he, will, be, unwavering, in, helping, advance, the, work, of, inclusive, justice, and, opportunity, for, all, that, must, be, part, of, life, within, osu, and, across, america, together, with, chief, rodriguez, he, will, help, us, move, in, the, right, direction, in, our, little, part, of, the, world, in, closing, i, ask, that, each, of, us, continue, to, participate, in, dialogue, leadership, and, understanding, as, we, seek, to, alter, the, direction, of, society, i, know, this, will, not, happen, overnight, but, by, god, it, needs, to, happen, soon
