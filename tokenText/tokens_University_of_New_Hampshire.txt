president, provost, call, for, focus, on, core, values, in, wake, of, george, floyd, death, minneapolis, june, dear, unh, community, like, virtually, all, americans, we, reacted, with, horror, at, the, recent, death, of, george, floyd, in, minneapolis, this, was, particularly, painful, coming, on, the, heels, of, the, shooting, of, ahmaud, arbery, in, georgia, and, breonna, taylor, in, kentucky, while, the, circumstances, of, these, deaths, were, different, they, all, underscore, the, risks, to, black, people, interacting, with, police, or, simply, going, about, their, daily, lives, as, was, demonstrated, vividly, by, what, happened, to, christian, cooper, in, new, york, city, it, is, beyond, belief, that, more, than, years, after, the, passage, of, the, civil, rights, act, nearly, years, after, rodney, beating, six, years, after, the, shooting, of, michael, brown, and, the, choking, death, of, eric, garner, tragedies, like, this, continue, to, occur, it, is, clear, that, as, former, president, obama, said, in, a, recent, statement, if, we, want, our, children, to, grow, up, in, a, nation, that, lives, up, to, its, highest, ideals, we, can, and, must, do, better, our, hearts, go, out, to, our, african, american, students, faculty, staff, and, alumni, who, are, particularly, affected, by, these, events, what, is, the, responsibility, of, a, public, university, like, the, university, of, new, hampshire, in, this, situation, we, have, an, obligation, to, fight, ignorance, intolerance, and, bias, and, to, teach, equality, respect, and, these, are, core, values, at, unh, the, university, is, where, we, tackle, societal, challenges, and, work, together, to, find, solutions, this, is, founded, on, our, mission, to, support, the, bedrock, american, principle, that, we, are, all, created, equal, and, that, all, of, us, regardless, of, any, differences, should, enjoy, equal, rights, opportunities, and, freedoms, it, is, fair, to, say, that, this, passion, for, freedom, is, particularly, acute, in, new, hampshire, we, must, ensure, that, our, students, and, the, whole, unh, community, deeply, understand, this, shared, commitment, to, our, fellow, citizens, to, better, understand, when, it, has, been, violated, our, recent, climate, survey, revealed, that, we, have, our, own, work, to, do, in, this, area, which, we, will, continue, to, do, we, can, not, remain, silent, in, the, face, of, the, trauma, that, these, events, inflict, on, marginalized, communities, across, the, country, we, are, united, in, our, rejection, of, hate, and, intolerance, and, call, upon, all, in, our, community, to, support, each, other, and, those, who, are, surely, feeling, the, weight, of, these, events, we, all, must, renew, our, commitment, to, providing, a, safe, and, inclusive, environment, for, everyone, at, unh, including, in, interactions, with, unh, and, durham, police, unh, police, chief, paul, dean, has, worked, extensively, to, build, strong, positive, relationships, with, underrepresented, students, and, has, provided, direction, and, training, to, his, officers, to, do, the, same, durham, police, chief, dave, kurz, has, done, this, as, well, as, a, research, university, we, also, have, the, responsibility, to, address, significant, national, issues, we, will, conduct, a, review, of, our, research, portfolio, and, look, for, opportunities, to, stimulate, and, support, research, on, this, important, national, problem, we, hope, that, research, can, help, us, to, identify, practical, steps, that, can, be, taken, to, protect, the, and, safety, of, all, americans, while, also, improving, our, own, racial, understanding, in, the, coming, weeks, we, will, be, meeting, with, and, creating, opportunities, for, faculty, staff, and, students, to, come, together, and, share, their, input, and, guidance, on, responding, to, this, challenge, even, in, the, face, of, the, pandemic, and, the, need, to, work, and, learn, remotely, we, must, not, lose, sight, of, the, importance, of, all, aspects, of, our, mission, in, the, aftermath, of, experiencing, or, witnessing, trauma, it, is, normal, to, experience, a, range, of, feelings, and, emotions, such, as, shock, fear, sadness, anger, helplessness, or, guilt, for, those, members, of, our, community, who, are, feeling, the, trauma, of, this, most, acutely, we, want, to, remind, you, that, services, continue, to, be, available, including, psychological, and, counseling, services, pacs, the, beauregard, center, formerly, omsa, health, and, wellness, and, the, office, of, community, equity, and, diversity, this, is, in, so, many, ways, a, challenging, time, in, america, but, we, as, a, people, have, risen, to, challenges, before, and, we, will, find, ways, to, meet, this, one, we, will, be, in, touch, with, more, detail, on, opportunities, for, education, research, and, conversation, soon, in, the, meantime, our, wish, for, all, of, you, is, health, and, safety, james, dean, president, wayne, jones, vice, president, and, provost
