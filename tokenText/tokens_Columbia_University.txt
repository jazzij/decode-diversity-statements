i, am, writing, in, both, a, personal, and, an, institutional, capacity, like, everyone, i, have, been, reflecting, on, the, events, of, the, last, week, with, an, increasing, sense, of, anguish, at, the, human, suffering, we, are, witnessing, and, of, alarm, at, the, national, crisis, we, are, facing, in, our, political, system, until, last, friday, i, did, not, think, it, was, possible, for, me, to, forget, even, for, a, moment, that, we, are, in, the, midst, of, an, historic, pandemic, bringing, untold, human, loss, and, crossing, a, numerical, threshold, of, unimaginable, proportions, but, the, horrifying, ending, of, the, life, of, george, floyd, a, citizen, in, the, very, system, of, justice, intended, to, protect, him, and, us, which, then, along, with, other, recent, tragic, deaths, drew, back, the, curtains, on, centuries, of, invidious, discrimination, against, african, americans, and, others, did, that, my, hopes, for, a, renewed, sense, of, national, purpose, to, continue, the, heroic, efforts, of, so, many, over, so, many, generations, to, change, once, and, for, all, that, terrible, course, of, history, have, been, raised, and, then, deflated, we, are, at, a, point, in, our, history, where, political, leadership, is, not, only, absent, but, also, disturbingly, confounding, of, the, fundamental, norms, and, values, that, take, years, and, years, of, hard, and, determined, work, to, and, yet, are, always, so, fragile, when, pitted, against, the, worst, instincts, of, human, nature, my, concerns, here, are, not, partisan, but, basic, to, our, culture, like, so, many, others, here, i, have, chosen, to, dedicate, my, life, to, sustaining, and, building, academic, institutions, and, my, beloved, columbia, specifically, there, is, no, question, that, the, expectations, of, intellectual, character, we, choose, to, live, by, in, the, academic, world, are, extreme, and, we, can, not, reasonably, expect, them, to, set, the, bar, for, ordinary, political, deliberations, and, interactions, but, what, we, are, seeing, which, unfortunately, included, just, in, the, last, week, an, unfounded, attack, on, our, research, and, researchers, as, well, as, on, the, university, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, spectrum, if, this, were, a, single, incident, that, would, be, one, thing, but, in, the, current, way, of, behaving, these, become, acts, of, intimidation, and, dangerous, mischaracterization, of, expertise, one, of, the, hallmarks, of, a, descent, into, authoritarianism, in, the, face, of, all, this, it, is, only, a, start, to, express, empathy, and, solidarity, with, those, in, our, community, who, are, experiencing, loss, and, apprehension, but, i, certainly, do, so, here, on, behalf, of, all, of, us, universities, are, not, perfect, and, we, have, to, accept, our, share, of, responsibility, for, the, state, of, affairs, we, have, today, but, we, are, determined, even, more, so, now, to, change, and, to, be, better, more, than, anything, we, will, continue, to, provide, the, society, and, the, world, with, all, the, knowledge, we, can, preserve, and, create, and, with, a, new, generation, of, citizens, and, leaders, who, are, prepared, to, live, by, and, fight, for, the, values, of, respect, for, reason, the, love, of, ideas, and, the, wish, to, use, these, to, care, for, others
