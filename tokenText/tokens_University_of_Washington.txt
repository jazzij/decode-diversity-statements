the, clarity, this, moment, offers, painful, though, it, may, be, we, must, face, up, to, the, inequities, this, pandemic, has, laid, bare, and, the, ugliness, that, it, has, revealed, we, are, all, in, this, together, i, wear, a, mask, not, to, protect, me, but, to, protect, you, and, it, is, also, unquestionably, true, that, we, are, not, all, on, equal, footing, there, are, class, and, race, differences, not, only, in, who, can, work, from, home, and, who, must, venture, out, but, in, who, has, kept, their, job, and, who, has, while, and, communities, of, color, are, more, apt, to, work,

neighborhoods, characterized, by, overcrowding, and, with, less, access, to, healthy, food, choices, and, recreational, activities, conditions, that, no, doubt, play, a, role, in, the, fact, that, people, of, color, are, more, apt, to, suffer, complications, and, even, death, from, these, structural, inequities, and, the, institutional, racism, that, they, reflect, create, and, amplify, the, conditions, that, led, to, the, appalling, ugliness, that, we, seen, in, the, last, few, days, and, weeks, laid, bare, once, again, by, ubiquity, of, cellphone, cameras, the, goal, should, not, be, to, go, back, to, the, way, it, was, we, must, do, better, as, we, enter, into, a, period, where, a, new, vigilance, around, hygiene, and, closeness, will, become, habitual, and, where, we, measure, the, consequences, of, our, individual, actions, not, just, by, their, effect, on, our, own, health, but, on, how, they, might, affect, our, family, and, friends, let, create, a, new, normal, where, attention, to, issues, of, equity, becomes, habitual, as, well, in, this, community, in, our, community, we, can, and, we, will, continue, our, work, to, address, issues, of, equity, racism, and,
