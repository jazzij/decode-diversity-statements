diversity, and, inclusion, recognizing, our, shortcomings, working, to, improve, over, the, past, few, days, we, were, made, aware, of, social, media, comments, made, by, a, few, students, that, are, racist, offensive, and, harmful, to, our, community, we, are, appalled, and, disheartened, that, any, member, of, the, nc, state, community, would, choose, to, make, such, abhorrent, statements, to, say, the, words, and, actions, in, those, posts, stand, in, complete, opposition, to, nc, values, is, an, understatement, as, a, public, institution, nc, state, is, bound, by, privacy, laws, such, that, we, can, not, share, information, about, individual, students, or, the, specifics, of, investigations, we, know, that, many, will, not, be, satisfied, with, this, response, but, please, know, these, incidents, are, being, addressed, at, this, challenging, time, across, our, nation, and, in, our, own, community, we, want, to, be, clear, where, nc, state, leadership, stands, we, stand, against, and, condemn, white, supremacy, racial, injustice, and, all, forms, of, racism, and, discrimination, nc, black, students, faculty, and, staff, deserve, a, campus, culture, where, they, feel, safe, supported, respected, and, valued, we, are, committed, to, doing, all, we, can, to, protect, promote, and, advance, diversity, equity, and, inclusion, at, nc, state, these, incidents, remind, us, that, we, fall, far, short, of, where, we, aim, to, be, we, need, to, do, more, and, do, better, as, a, wolfpack, we, must, remain, united, and, committed, every, one, of, us, must, actively, contribute, to, help, ensure, a, more, diverse, and, inclusive, environment, and, we, need, to, be, innovative, and, try, new, ideas, and, approaches, to, embrace, and, advance, diversity, and, inclusion, we, may, not, get, it, right, every, time, but, we, are, committed, to, listening, to, the, voices, and, lived, experiences, of, those, impacted, and, challenging, ourselves, to, do, the, work, necessary, to, build, a, more, just, and, equitable, nc, state, as, one, first, step, in, the, coming, academic, year, we, will, require, every, student, faculty, and, staff, member, to, complete, diversity, and, inclusion, learning, modules, this, will, include, every, member, of, cabinet, as, well, as, all, of, the, deans, directors, and, department, heads, of, the, university, as, another, step, we, are, assembling, an, interdisciplinary, team, to, evaluate, nc, policies, examine, every, opportunity, to, strengthen, them, against, racism, and, discriminatory, behavior, and, modify, where, allowed, by, law, to, bolster, our, commitment, to, diversity, equity, and, inclusion, when, students, return, in, the, fall, we, commit, to, working, with, them, to, collaboratively, review, nc, code, of, student, conduct, and, examine, opportunities, for, improving, and, strengthening, the, code, where, allowed, by, law, we, will, also, work, with, students, to, review, update, and, improve, our, statement, of, values, when, complete, we, will, expect, every, student, at, nc, state, to, uphold, these, values, that, define, the, inclusive, and, supportive, culture, that, we, seek, for, our, community, additionally, when, students, faculty, and, staff, return, to, campus, we, want, to, move, to, a, place, of, dialogue, and, partnership, to, have, difficult, but, necessary, conversations, better, gauge, what, is, needed, what, is, possible, and, working, together, what, going, to, do, about, it, we, are, working, on, a, plan, to, facilitate, those, discussions, these, are, not, the, last, things, we, will, do, and, they, are, not, nearly, enough, to, overcome, the, many, challenges, related, to, actively, addressing, both, the, individual, acts, of, racism, and, the, system, of, racism, to, foster, belonging, for, all, but, they, are, a, few, next, steps, and, we, are, fully, committed, to, doing, more, to, keep, moving, forward, we, are, a, university, that, is, about, transforming, lives, and, making, the, world, a, better, place, this, mission, is, more, important, today, than, ever, before, we, have, much, work, yet, to, do, work, that, will, require, humility, empathy, resilience, hope, and, engagement, we, remain, committed, to, striving, today, and, every, day, to, ensure, a, university, climate, that, embraces, values, and, advances, a,
