recent, month, have, cast, a, long, shadow, a, the, pandemic, continues, it, deadly, toll, on, the, nation, ravag, black, brown, and, native, american, community, in, particular, and, in, the, midst, of, such, anguish, the, image, of, black, american, treated, without, humanity, and, in, some, case, brutalized, in, the, last, moment, of, their, earthly, life, trigger, wave, of, emotion, includ, stagger, grief, and, righteous, anger, this, constant, attack, on, the, black, experience, must, end, i, am, the, proud, father, of, two, precocious, teenager, like, many, parent, we, have, very, purposely, had, the, talk, the, unwelcome, but, necessary, conversation, about, how, to, prepare, for, engagement, with, law, enforcement, watch, these, example, of, social, injustice, and, unrest, in, the, presence, of, my, son, ha, brought, up, some, difficult, conversation, he, reminded, me, of, a, time, when, we, were, head, to, campus, and, were, pulled, over, i, personally, do, recall, all, the, detail, of, that, stop, however, my, son, vividly, remembers, the, anger, he, felt, a, a, result, of, the, interaction, upon, see, the, news, out, of, minneapolis, he, turned, to, me, and, asked, dad, should, i, just, fall, to, the, ground, if, a, cop, approach, me, pray, for, the, right, word, to, say, i, told, him, that, he, should, remain, calm, and, try, to, express, himself, to, the, best, of, his, ability, yet, even, after, struggl, through, that, conversation, the, myriad, name, of, innocent, black, life, taken, through, lethal, force, young, and, old, men, and, woman, testify, to, the, insufficiency, of, that, advice, this, moment, of, compound, crisis, leaf, little, doubt, that, the, daily, experience, of, so, many, in, our, community, remain, marked, by, heightened, vulnerability, and, a, likelihood, to, encounter, deadly, force, at, the, hand, of, misguided, individual, or, those, whose, bigoted, view, betray, the, oath, they, swore, to, protect, and, serve, howard, university, emerged, from, the, ash, of, the, american, civil, war, a, conflict, that, raised, but, hardly, resolved, the, racial, divide, in, this, nation, firmly, rooted, in, a, promise, that, offered, the, transformative, power, of, education, to, all, howard, ha, consistently, taught, that, the, highest, use, of, knowledge, gained, at, the, mecca, is, demonstrated, in, service, above, self, focused, on, address, systematic, injustice, and, entrenched, interest, antagonistic, to, our, enjoyment, of, life, and, liberty, our, scholar, have, enlightened, our, physician, have, healed, our, lawyer, have, advocated, our, activist, have, agitated, our, entrepreneur, have, built, our, counselor, have, comforted, and, our, artist, have, enriched, even, life, itself, our, nation, would, be, a, shadow, of, itself, and, remain, a, imperfect, a, it, wa, at, it, inception, without, the, contribution, of, howard, university, and, all, it, stand, for, in, the, context, of, current, event, there, must, always, be, accountability, for, all, found, responsible, through, a, fair, and, thorough, investigation, so, that, justice, is, served, yet, even, a, we, see, individual, perpetrator, on, our, screen, we, must, remain, mindful, that, the, distorted, worldviews, and, ugly, bias, have, too, often, been, codified, into, inequitable, or, predatory, system, are, equally, culpable, the, book, of, ephesian, reminds, u, for, we, wrestle, not, against, flesh, and, blood, but, against, principality, against, power, against, the, ruler, of, the, darkness, of, this, world, against, spiritual, wickedness, in, high, place, we, were, born, for, such, a, time, a, this, and, i, am, convinced, that, institution, like, howard, university, are, destined, to, continue, to, build, mold, and, train, the, leader, who, will, help, bring, needed, change, to, the, structure, of, our, society, no, pandemic, no, declin, economy, no, period, of, prosperity, and, no, cure, for, every, medical, ailment, will, undo, or, hide, the, reality, of, the, black, experience, we, must, bring, consistency, to, that, struggle, and, focus, our, intellect, and, passion, daily, to, prepare, for, the, hard, work, that, must, be, done, to, confront, evil, and, systematic, oppression, a, student, remain, vigilant, about, your, study, you, are, matricul, through, howard, university, for, a, purpose, that, is, greater, than, yourselves, you, are, the, hope, of, our, ancestor, and, despite, the, new, challenge, that, will, come, our, way, each, day, that, you, remain, resolved, to, focus, on, your, destiny, is, a, day, that, brings, u, closer, to, resolution, to, many, of, our, world, dilemma, a, faculty, continue, to, focus, our, energy, and, concern, on, our, student, so, that, they, would, be, nurtured, thrive, and, excel, we, all, are, intricately, woven, into, the, fabric, of, the, howard, university, legacy, keep, research, write, and, speak, out, to, craft, solution, to, the, contemporary, challenge, we, face, we, must, be, diligent, in, our, work, and, conversation, with, student, to, hear, and, walk, with, them, through, these, tri, time, let, not, forget, that, we, are, all, live, these, experience, in, our, daily, life, outside, of, howard, it, is, everywhere, that, we, are, let, first, start, by, not, look, past, each, other, wherever, we, may, be, and, work, on, actively, love, each, other, in, this, moment, it, is, necessary, to, grieve, over, another, life, taken, unnecessarily, and, those, who, loved, him, who, are, now, broken, and, left, behind, to,
