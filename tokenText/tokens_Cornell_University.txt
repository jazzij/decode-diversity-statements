like, so, many, of, you, my, family, and, i, have, been, reeling, over, the, events, of, the, past, week, events, for, which, words, seem, inadequate, the, images, we, have, seen, and, the, sounds, we, have, heard, have, horrified, us, and, broken, our, hearts, we, are, ashamed, of, the, injustices, that, are, perpetrated, in, our, country, every, day, against, people, of, color, and, of, the, reality, that, years, after, cornell, was, founded, to, help, heal, the, wounds, of, a, broken, nation, that, nation, is, in, many, ways, still, so, badly, broken, the, extraordinary, times, in, which, we, are, living, are, shining, a, spotlight, on, so, many, issues, of, equity, and, the, lack, of, it, on, the, ways, that, rights, and, opportunity, are, unevenly, distributed, across, our, society, and, the, worth, of, our, labor, and, our, lives, unequally, valued, as, an, academic, community, built, on, the, bedrock, values, of, diversity, inclusion, and, openness, we, have, an, obligation, to, ensure, that, the, forces, of, these, events, and, our, feelings, drive, us, not, backward, but, forward, over, these, past, days, the, words, that, have, resonated, with, me, the, most, as, i, have, struggled, with, the, question, of, how, our, community, can, best, embrace, our, collective, challenge, are, those, of, the, rev, william, barber, ii, spoken, to, an, empty, church, in, goldsboro, north, carolina, this, past, sunday, we, can, not, try, to, hurry, up, and, put, the, screams, and, the, tears, and, the, hurt, back, in, the, bottle, just, to, get, back, to, some, normal, that, was, abnormal, in, the, first, place, hear, the, screams, feel, the, tears, the, very, people, who, have, been, rejected, over, and, over, again, are, the, ones, who, have, shown, us, the, possibility, of, a, more, perfect, nation, words, are, important, words, matter, but, our, words, of, sympathy, of, support, of, shared, pain, are, not, enough, while, the, challenges, are, enormous, and, we, can, not, fix, them, on, our, own, that, does, not, absolve, us, from, taking, whatever, steps, we, can, to, fight, against, systemic, racism, and, structural, inequality, as, a, community, we, can, and, must, act, through, our, teaching, our, research, and, our, engagement, to, stand, up, for, those, who, are, oppressed, or, marginalized, to, educate, ourselves, and, others, and, to, work, to, ensure, that, we, our, entire, society, do, better, here, are, some, of, the, things, that, cornell, will, do, immediately, strengthen, community, involvement, in, public, safety, cornell, public, safety, advisory, committee, psac, is, composed, of, students, staff, and, faculty, members, who, advise, cornell, university, police, on, issues, of, public, safety, and, victims, advocacy, the, committee, which, last, met, in, april, makes, recommendations, to, improve, campus, security, policies, and, procedures, and, reviews, issues, that, affect, the, overall, safety, and, of, cornell, diverse, community, i, have, asked, the, psac, to, redouble, their, efforts, to, engage, our, community, with, a, specific, focus, on, procedures, and, training, in, the, areas, of, use, of, force, techniques, and, cultural, competency, summit, with, regional, law, enforcement, agencies, in, addition, to, the, work, of, the, psac, the, university, administration, has, convened, discussions, in, recent, years, with, representatives, of, regional, law, enforcement, agencies, including, cornell, university, police, the, ithaca, police, department, the, tompkins, county, sheriff, office, and, the, new, york, state, police, these, conversations, have, touched, on, shared, interests, with, a, focus, on, understanding, and, sharing, best, practices, around, law, enforcement, interactions, with, communities, of, color, we, will, organize, another, session, as, soon, as, possible, and, include, student, staff, and, faculty, representatives, in, this, important, ongoing, conversation, community, conversations, on, race, and, racism, using, the, community, chat, framework, the, office, of, human, resources, will, be, offering, zoom, sessions, on, topics, such, as, institutional, racism, and, the, context, of, the, current, protests, ways, to, be, an, ally, to, our, black, colleagues, and, how, to, engage, in, proactive, and, meaningful, dialogue, around, difficult, topics, such, as, racism, details, on, the, programs, and, information, on, how, to, register, will, be, sent, to, all, staff, and, faculty, members, by, vice, president, mary, opperman, early, next, week, campus, community, book, read, as, a, campus, community, we, have, a, collective, responsibility, to, engage, in, difficult, but, critical, conversations, to, listen, genuinely, to, and, learn, from, one, another, to, help, bring, focus, to, these, conversations, i, invite, all, of, you, to, participate, in, a, community, book, read, of, how, to, be, an, antiracist, by, national, book, award, winner, ibram, kendi, we, will, soon, provide, all, students, faculty, and, staff, with, information, about, how, to, access, an, electronic, copy, of, the, book, along, with, a, schedule, of, virtual, discussions, which, will, take, place, over, the, summer, i, hope, you, will, choose, to, read, the, book, and, to, join, in, the, conversation, dialogue, with, local, community, leaders, i, will, be, meeting, next, week, with, a, diverse, group, of, local, elected, nonprofit, business, and, faith, community, leaders, to, review, the, events, of, the, last, few, weeks, and, consider, how, we, might, advance, initiatives, to, further, support, the, needs, of, our, friends, and, neighbors, these, plans, are, in, addition, to, the, ongoing, work, of, the, belonging, at, cornell, framework, that, emerged, from, our, diversity, and, inclusion, initiatives, many, of, which, were, proposed, by, the, president, task, force, on, campus, climate, the, provost, task, force, to, enhance, faculty, diversity, more, than, of, the, goals, laid, out, by, the, task, force, in, have, now, been, achieved, including, the, creation, of, a, mandatory, intergroup, dialogue, project, experience, for, all, new, undergraduates, an, improved, bias, reporting, process, implicit, bias, training, for, all, faculty, search, committees, and, increased, support, from, the, provost, for, faculty, hires, that, advance, diversity, all, of, this, work, will, continue, but, so, much, more, needs, to, be, done, at, cornell, and, beyond, i, want, to, close, by, echoing, the, words, of, the, rev, barber, in, saying, that, there, will, be, no, return, to, normal, from, where, we, are, right, now, we, are, in, a, time, of, profound, societal, change, change, that, we, as, a, community, and, a, society, have, the, power, to, influence, and, to, shape, we, can, and, we, will, rise, to, this, challenge, our, own, consciences, demand, it, as, do, our, values, as, a, community, and, our, ethos, as, cornellians
