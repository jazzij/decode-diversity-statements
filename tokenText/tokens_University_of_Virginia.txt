to, the, university, community, on, sunday, i, offered, some, brief, reflections, on, social, media, regarding, the, death, of, george, floyd, those, reflections, and, that, medium, were, inadequate, to, the, topic, which, is, why, i, am, writing, you, today, let, me, start, with, the, obvious, but, nonetheless, essential, what, happened, to, george, floyd, his, callous, and, indifferent, killing, at, the, hands, of, a, white, police, officer, was, immoral, and, sickening, as, dean, risa, goluboff, wrote, recently, it, might, be, tempting, also, to, say, it, was, shocking, but, that, wrongly, suggests, it, was, surprising, the, recent, and, senseless, deaths, of, ahmaud, arbery, breonna, taylor, and, so, many, others, before, them, whose, lives, were, cut, short, demonstrate, otherwise, this, sort, of, violence, against, black, people, including, at, the, hands, of, those, who, are, supposed, to, protect, all, of, us, is, sadly, all, too, familiar, and, stretches, back, not, just, decades, but, centuries, through, the, civil, rights, era, jim, crow, reconstruction, and, slavery, and, let, me, apologize, when, i, wrote, last, weekend, i, felt, deep, despair, despair, for, the, treatment, experienced, by, so, many, people, of, color, in, this, country, not, just, by, police, but, by, every, segment, of, society, including, higher, education, including, here, at, uva, despair, for, the, current, state, of, our, country, which, seems, to, be, unraveling, before, our, eyes, despair, for, the, continued, racial, inequities, across, a, wide, range, of, contexts, education, criminal, justice, health, care, housing, jobs, that, are, still, there, as, is, the, systemic, racism, that, underlies, those, inequities, but, in, my, own, despair, in, indulging, in, it, i, failed, to, express, the, genuine, sorrow, i, feel, for, the, unequal, and, unfair, burden, that, i, know, our, black, students, faculty, and, staff, carry, with, them, not, just, through, this, episode, but, through, every, day, george, floyd, death, is, just, another, sharp, reminder, that, far, too, many, people, of, color, in, this, country, live, a, life, that, is, less, secure, less, safe, than, white, people, in, part, because, of, encounters, with, police, officers, who, inflicted, harm, on, people, they, were, meant, to, protect, as, a, white, parent, of, four, kids, i, have, not, had, to, have, the, conversation, that, so, many, black, parents, have, had, with, theirs, cautioning, them, about, how, to, behave, around, those, who, are, meant, to, protect, all, of, us, for, all, of, that, i, am, truly, sorry, both, for, that, burden, and, for, failing, to, acknowledge, it, and, i, know, it, time, to, act, and, not, simply, to, despair, or, rest, on, faith, over, the, weekend, the, division, for, diversity, equity, and, inclusion, at, uva, posted, a, powerful, statement, from, a, group, of, faculty, staff, and, community, members, reflecting, on, the, latest, tragedies, in, it, they, wrote, we, must, continue, to, do, the, hard, work, that, will, help, ensure, that, our, future, is, different, more, just, more, accepting, and, more, inclusive, the, future, we, envision, is, one, in, which, the, devaluing, of, life, is, no, longer, accepted, and, where, bigotry, no, longer, contaminates, our, systems, and, institutions, burdening, some, community, members, much, more, than, others, i, could, agree, more, and, i, am, committed, to, that, work, it, in, many, ways, why, i, came, back, here, through, the, hard, work, of, many, students, faculty, and, staff, not, to, mention, the, persistent, advocacy, of, alumni, and, community, members, uva, is, a, better, place, today, than, it, was, a, decade, ago, or, the, decade, before, that, but, there, is, more, work, to, do, in, order, for, uva, to, look, more, like, the, state, and, country, in, which, we, live, in, order, for, uva, to, be, a, trusted, neighbor, to, the, charlottesville, region, and, in, order, for, all, students, faculty, and, staff, to, have, their, voices, and, their, presence, equally, valued, respected, and, included, in, their, everyday, lives, on, grounds, i, have, tried, to, champion, some, of, that, work, in, my, two, years, as, president, and, some, of, it, like, increasing, student, and, faculty, diversity, and, being, a, good, neighbor, to, the, charlottesville, region, is, in, our, strategic, plan, to, complement, and, push, that, work, forward, today, i, have, asked, three, colleagues, to, lead, a, racial, equity, task, force, ian, solomon, the, dean, of, the, batten, school, of, public, policy, kevin, mcdonald, our, vice, president, for, diversity, equity, and, inclusion, and, barbara, brown, wilson, a, faculty, member, in, the, school, of, architecture, and, the, faculty, director, of, the, equity, center, this, group, will, convene, with, students, faculty, and, staff, to, gather, together, the, growing, list, of, recommendations, suggestions, and, demands, regarding, the, subject, of, racial, equity, at, uva, and, to, solicit, others, and, will, send, me, a, concrete, and, prioritized, set, of, recommendations, about, the, best, steps, forward, including, actions, that, can, be, implemented, right, away, eleven, days, after, i, returned, to, uva, to, begin, as, president, i, spoke, at, an, event, to, mark, and, remember, the, anniversary, of, the, white, supremacist, march, through, grounds, the, year, before, as, i, said, then, and, will, say, again, here, i, stand, here, today, as, an, ally, i, am, surely, an, imperfect, one, which, is, to, say, i, am, human, like, all, of, you, i, will, disappoint, some, of, you, for, doing, too, much, and, others, for, doing, too, little, some, for, going, too, fast, and, others, for, not, going, fast, enough, but, i, know, in, my, heart, where, i, would, like, to, go, and, that, is, the, place, where, our, aspirations, and, our, realities, finally, intersect, i, know, that, many, of, you, so, many, of, you, would, like, to, get, there, as, well, i, look, forward, to, our, continued, imperfect, journey, together, best, jim, james, ryan, president, university,
