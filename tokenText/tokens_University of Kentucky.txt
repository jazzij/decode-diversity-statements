memorial, hall, mural, our, past, our, present, and, why, it, time, to, move, forward, by, president, eli, capilouto, friday, lexington, june, on, friday, june, university, of, kentucky, president, eli, capilouto, sent, the, follow, message, to, all, student, faculty, and, staff, i, have, not, been, able, to, get, the, image, out, of, my, mind, and, the, image, should, be, and, will, be, forever, in, my, mind, for, eight, minute, and, second, on, a, street, in, an, american, city, in, george, floyd, wa, suffocated, to, death, a, knee, at, his, neck, gasp, escap, from, his, mouth, a, he, pleaded, for, his, life, and, for, his, mother, i, ca, adequately, articulate, the, horror, and, disturb, nature, of, those, image, to, me, i, do, have, word, to, capture, the, mix, of, emotion, of, anger, and, sadness, disbelief, and, nag, recognition, that, we, have, been, here, before, that, have, gnawed, at, me, for, day, but, i, also, know, that, i, ca, begin, to, feel, how, a, black, man, or, woman, or, the, parent, of, a, black, child, process, those, image, either, to, every, issue, we, bring, our, curated, experience, funneled, through, the, prism, of, our, mind, eye, to, an, incident, like, this, one, or, for, that, matter, to, a, work, of, music, write, or, art, those, sound, image, and, narrative, are, necessarily, interpreted, with, the, context, of, a, given, moment, by, generation, of, people, over, the, passage, of, time, the, simple, truth, is, i, ca, walk, in, their, shoe, i, ca, be, in, their, skin, and, i, ca, understand, what, intergenerational, subjugation, doe, to, family, who, are, it, victim, but, i, can, try, for, greater, understand, a, deeper, sense, of, empathy, and, renewed, resolve, to, contribute, to, heal, to, do, justice, and, to, find, reconciliation, a, much, a, racism, is, a, systemic, stain, on, our, country, so, too, are, we, the, inheritor, of, king, admonition, that, the, moral, arc, of, the, universe, ultimately, bend, toward, justice, that, is, where, i, believe, we, find, ourselves, a, a, campus, community, today, we, have, not, been, immune, from, racial, prejudice, and, hate, but, i, believe, deeply, that, there, is, a, commitment, to, do, better, tomorrow, than, we, are, do, today, it, against, that, imperfect, and, human, backdrop, that, i, am, direct, our, facility, team, to, immediately, begin, the, process, of, remov, the, mural, in, memorial, hall, why, now, and, what, doe, this, move, accomplish, just, a, certain, image, haunt, me, i, also, can, not, escape, certain, conversation, that, over, year, remain, fresh, to, many, the, mural, represents, the, work, of, a, renowned, artist, seek, in, her, time, to, represent, the, evolution, however, halt, of, her, native, state, and, a, with, all, art, we, seek, to, understand, the, intent, of, the, artist, and, bring, our, own, mean, and, interpretation, to, it, i, remember, a, conversation, at, maxwell, place, with, african, american, student, in, the, fall, of, there, they, detailed, a, list, of, recommendation, that, included, racist, mural, in, memorial, hall, there, wa, a, conversation, with, one, student, about, the, mural, who, stopped, me, cold, with, the, observation, that, every, time, he, walked, into, a, class, in, memorial, hall, he, wa, forced, to, reckon, with, the, fact, that, his, forbear, were, enslaved, they, were, chattel, brutalized, a, disposable, property, even, though, in, their, time, they, were, regarded, a, essential, to, the, economy, progress, the, art, to, this, student, sought, to, glorify, and, sanitize, that, fact, and, he, wa, speak, for, many, others, over, many, year, a, point, made, clear, again, to, me, recently, a, we, began, conversation, with, our, student, leader, on, how, to, move, forward, dure, this, fraught, time, the, mural, once, again, wa, a, symbol, not, of, a, state, evolution, but, of, our, unwillingness, to, recognize, their, experience, a, member, of, our, community, memorial, hall, of, course, ha, it, own, important, story, the, story, of, the, uk, student, and, kentuckian, who, laid, down, their, life, dure, the, great, war, it, is, a, build, constructed, in, honor, of, all, kentuckian, african, american, native, american, and, woman, alike, who, gave, their, life, to, preserve, liberty, how, do, we, reconcile, those, image, a, perceived, now, with, that, narrative, to, be, sure, we, have, discussed, the, mural, for, many, year, and, made, a, number, of, important, productive, effort, to, seek, common, ground, and, last, solution, but, the, space, we, have, created, for, dialogue, and, the, work, we, have, commissioned, to, expand, conversation, and, contextualize, art, have, worked, frankly, our, effort, and, solution, with, the, mural, for, many, of, our, student, have, been, a, roadblock, to, reconciliation, rather, than, a, path, toward, heal, that, not, a, criticism, it, is, a, statement, of, fact, and, i, hope, understand, we, need, to, move, forward, we, have, a, lot, of, discussion, that, need, to, take, place, on, our, campus, and, those, discussion, can, not, obviate, the, necessity, of, thoughtful, but, decisive, action, on, a, number, of, front, i, do, believe, we, can, have, that, conversation, with, the, mural, still, metaphorically, on, the, table, and, so, while, in, the, context, of, many, significant, issue, we, must, discus, and, decide, upon, the, mural, may, appear, relatively, small, it, carry, with, it, tremendous, symbolic, weight, i, want, to, remove, that, weight, from, the, discussion, we, must, have, so, that, we, can, act, together, a, a, community, a, we, determine, how, we, can, move, forward, with, remov, the, mural, i, will, communicate, with, the, campus, there, is, rarely, a, perfect, solution, to, challeng, issue, but, it, is, the, right, one, i, believe, for, our, campus, at, this, moment, and, in, the, year, to, come, eli, capilouto, medium, note, downloadable, video, and, photo, available, at, http, the, university, of, kentucky, is, increasingly, the, first, choice, for, student, faculty, and, staff, to, pursue, their, passion, and, their, professional, goal, in, the, last, two, year, forbes, ha, named, uk, among, the, best, employer, for, diversity, and, insight, into, diversity, recognized, u, a, a, diversity, champion, three, year, run, uk, is, ranked, among, the, top, campus, in, the, nation, for, lgbtq, inclusion, and, safety, uk, ha, been, judged, a, great, college, to, work, for, two, year, in, a, row, and, uk, is, among, only, university, in, the, country, on, forbes, list, of, america, best, employer, we, are, ranked, among, the, top, percent, of, public, institution, for, research, expenditure, a, tangible, symbol,

the, state, top, hospital, for, four, straight, year, accolade, and, honor, are, great, but, they, are, more, important, for, what, they, represent, the, idea, that, creat, a, community, of, belong, and, commitment, to, excellence, is, how, we, honor, our, mission, to, be, not, simply, the, university, of, kentucky, but, the, university, for, kentucky
