to, the, university, community, on, sunday, i, offered, some, brief, reflection, on, social, medium, regard, the, death, of, george, floyd, those, reflection, and, that, medium, were, inadequate, to, the, topic, which, is, why, i, am, write, you, today, let, me, start, with, the, obvious, but, nonetheless, essential, what, happened, to, george, floyd, his, callous, and, indifferent, kill, at, the, hand, of, a, white, police, officer, wa, immoral, and, sicken, a, dean, risa, goluboff, wrote, recently, it, might, be, tempt, also, to, say, it, wa, shock, but, that, wrongly, suggests, it, wa, surpris, the, recent, and, senseless, death, of, ahmaud, arbery, breonna, taylor, and, so, many, others, before, them, whose, life, were, cut, short, demonstrate, otherwise, this, sort, of, violence, against, black, people, includ, at, the, hand, of, those, who, are, supposed, to, protect, all, of, u, is, sadly, all, too, familiar, and, stretch, back, not, just, decade, but, century, through, the, civil, right, era, jim, crow, reconstruction, and, slavery, and, let, me, apologize, when, i, wrote, last, weekend, i, felt, deep, despair, despair, for, the, treatment, experienced, by, so, many, people, of, color, in, this, country, not, just, by, police, but, by, every, segment, of, society, includ, higher, education, includ, here, at, uva, despair, for, the, current, state, of, our, country, which, seems, to, be, unravel, before, our, eye, despair, for, the, continued, racial, inequity, across, a, wide, range, of, context, education, criminal, justice, health, care, hous, job, that, are, still, there, a, is, the, systemic, racism, that, underlies, those, inequity, but, in, my, own, despair, in, indulg, in, it, i, failed, to, express, the, genuine, sorrow, i, feel, for, the, unequal, and, unfair, burden, that, i, know, our, black, student, faculty, and, staff, carry, with, them, not, just, through, this, episode, but, through, every, day, george, floyd, death, is, just, another, sharp, reminder, that, far, too, many, people, of, color, in, this, country, live, a, life, that, is, le, secure, le, safe, than, white, people, in, part, because, of, encounter, with, police, officer, who, inflicted, harm, on, people, they, were, meant, to, protect, a, a, white, parent, of, four, kid, i, have, not, had, to, have, the, conversation, that, so, many, black, parent, have, had, with, theirs, caution, them, about, how, to, behave, around, those, who, are, meant, to, protect, all, of, u, for, all, of, that, i, am, truly, sorry, both, for, that, burden, and, for, fail, to, acknowledge, it, and, i, know, it, time, to, act, and, not, simply, to, despair, or, rest, on, faith, over, the, weekend, the, division, for, diversity, equity, and, inclusion, at, uva, posted, a, powerful, statement, from, a, group, of, faculty, staff, and, community, member, reflect, on, the, latest, tragedy, in, it, they, wrote, we, must, continue, to, do, the, hard, work, that, will, help, ensure, that, our, future, is, different, more, just, more, accept, and, more, inclusive, the, future, we, envision, is, one, in, which, the, devalu, of, life, is, no, longer, accepted, and, where, bigotry, no, longer, contaminates, our, system, and, institution, burden, some, community, member, much, more, than, others, i, could, agree, more, and, i, am, committed, to, that, work, it, in, many, way, why, i, came, back, here, through, the, hard, work, of, many, student, faculty, and, staff, not, to, mention, the, persistent, advocacy, of, alumnus, and, community, member, uva, is, a, better, place, today, than, it, wa, a, decade, ago, or, the, decade, before, that, but, there, is, more, work, to, do, in, order, for, uva, to, look, more, like, the, state, and, country, in, which, we, live, in, order, for, uva, to, be, a, trusted, neighbor, to, the, charlottesville, region, and, in, order, for, all, student, faculty, and, staff, to, have, their, voice, and, their, presence, equally, valued, respected, and, included, in, their, everyday, life, on, ground, i, have, tried, to, champion, some, of, that, work, in, my, two, year, a, president, and, some, of, it, like, increas, student, and, faculty, diversity, and, be, a, good, neighbor, to, the, charlottesville, region, is, in, our, strategic, plan, to, complement, and, push, that, work, forward, today, i,

and, others, for, do, too, little, some, for, go, too, fast, and, others, for, not, go, fast, enough, but, i, know, in, my, heart, where, i, would, like, to, go, and, that, is, the, place, where, our,
