dear, member, of, the, yale, community, i, write, to, you, today, deeply, upset, by, the, kill, of, george, floyd, while, he, wa, in, the, custody, of, minneapolis, police, officer, floyd, death, follows, a, pattern, of, racial, injustice, that, ha, become, too, familiar, in, our, country, and, that, amount, to, a, national, emergency, at, a, time, when, the, american, community, must, come, together, more, than, ever, before, george, floyd, horrifi, death, shock, our, shared, conscience, and, indicts, our, shared, failure, it, can, and, must, remind, u, of, other, similar, killing, and, of, the, racism, nativism, and, bigotry, too, pervasive, in, society, today, and, throughout, our, country, history, over, the, past, week, i, have, been, think, about, two, seemingly, incongruous, our, sense, of, community, and, one, of, our, most, basic, emotion, fear, since, the, start, of, the, pandemic, legitimate, fear, ha, been, very, much, with, u, but, not, just, about, the, virus, itself, and, not, among, u, equally, from, report, of, racism, against, people, of, asian, descent, to, the, unacceptable, disparity, in, health, outcome, and, health, care, there, wa, every, reason, for, u, to, fear, for, the, safety, of, our, neighbor, and, family, member, and, of, some, sadly, more, than, of, others, at, the, same, time, i, saw, nurse, doctor, support, staff, and, volunteer, act, with, courage, selflessness, and, compassion, in, our, home, city, and, around, the, world, we, nurtured, a, grow, sense, of, community, which, gave, u, the, optimism, and, hope, that, must, ever, be, a, cornerstone, of, our, beloved, country, it, is, in, the, face, of, that, noble, expression, of, solidarity, that, george, floyd, death, ha, shaken, u, and, the, shared, spirit, of, heroism, we, have, aroused, to, fight, the, pandemic, a, i, read, the, news, report, of, floyd, death, and, it, explosive, response, i, knew, that, many, member, of, our, community, feel, fear, in, their, daily, life, because, of, the, injustice, they, have, experienced, and, witnessed, and, i, thought, of, how, fear, so, reliably, lead, to, anxiety, depression, health, deterioration, and, anger, and, also, to, aggression, and, even, violence, some, of, the, protest, have, turned, destructive, undermin, the, plea, for, justice, all, american, must, share, fear, is, powerful, damag, and, unpredictable, in, it, effect, i, believe, that, all, of, u, at, yale, must, do, what, we, can, to, replace, fear, with, and, not, with, anyth, le, than, action, here, i, have, been, think, much, of, the, life, of, the, extraordinary, pauli, murray, a, lawyer, civil, right, leader, and, yale, law, school, graduate, she, experienced, firsthand, the, cruelty, of, racial, segregation, and, suffered, injustice, she, knew, fear, however, she, wrote, in, her, memoir, see, the, relationship, between, my, personal, cause, and, the, universal, cause, of, freedom, released, me, from, a, sense, of, would, be, no, le, afraid, to, challenge, the, system, of, racial, segregation, but, the, heightened, significance, of, my, cause, would, impel, me, to, act, in, spite, of, my, fear, i, have, implored, and, earnestly, invite, you, to, do, the, to, make, direct, use, of, pauli, murray, wisdom, her, word, remind, u, of, all, that, we, have, been, able, to, accomplish, together, because, of, our, shared, commitment, to, the, common, good, since, we, have, saved, life, in, this, pandemic, we, have, isolated, ourselves, changed, the, way, we, live, and, sacrificed, to, safeguard, the, of, the, most, vulnerable, among, u, and, prevent, our, hospital, from, becom, overwhelmed, it, is, vital, to, remember, that, we, have, been, united, in, eas, suffer, improv, life, and, provid, hope, dure, a, turbulent, and, challeng, period, of, our, history, if, we, can, do, this, we, are, capable, all, of, u, of, creat, the, america, we, must, insist, belongs, to, u, all, in, pauli, murray, wrote, a, an, american, i, inherit, the, magnificent, tradition, of, an, endless, march, toward, freedom, and, toward, the, dignity, of, all, mankind, we, have, so, much, more, to, do, to, foster, and, sustain, an, equitable, society, instead, of, feel, the, isol, effect, of, fear, when, our, sense, of, community, is, shaken, we, must, remember, that, we, are, connected, in, more, way, than, we, are, divided, and, that, where, we, are, divided, we, must, work, now, in, the, interest, of, unity, and, justice, this, is, a, matter, of, the, highest, importance, so, let, u, act, a, pauli,
