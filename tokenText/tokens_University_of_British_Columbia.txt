together, against, racism, and, injustice, june, dear, ubc, community, recent, and, violence, in, communities, across, north, america, has, focused, our, attention, on, the, deeply, rooted, racism, in, canada, and, globally, ubc, itself, is, not, immune, to, racism, and, injustice, as, a, university, we, need, to, make, it, crystal, clear, that, racism, and, bias, have, no, place, in, our, community, and, that, we, have, zero, tolerance, for, it, on, behalf, of, the, university, i, condemn, and, denounce, all, incidents, of, and, racism, and, the, continued, racism, and, oppression,

everyday, systems, it, is, my, hope, that, at, least, here, at, ubc, we, can, work, to, model, a, different, kind, of, community, one, where, we, embrace, difference, and, work, to, build, each, other, up, while, enacting, values, of, dignity, mutual, respect, and, justice, deeply, connected, to, the, wider, region, and, benefiting, from, the, privilege, of, being, on, unceded, land, ubc,

an, obligation, and, commitment, towards, the, public, good, and, as, a, place, of, learning, and, engagement, we, are, uniquely, positioned, to, generate, and, mobilize, knowledge, that, can, transform, systems, of, oppression, and, support, emerging, leaders, that, can, help, shape, not, only, our, campus, but, workplaces, and, communities, beyond, our, campuses, as, such, we, will, be,
