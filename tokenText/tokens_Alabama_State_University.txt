what, do, we, tell, our, children, our, students, expressions, from, alabama, state, university, president, quinton, ross, on, recent, national, events, surrounding, the, death, of, george, floyd, by, quinton, ross, president, of, alabama, state, university, for, the, past, few, days, i, like, many, others, have, been, viewing, through, the, lens, of, the, media, the, reaction, of, our, country, to, the, deplorable, and, senseless, death, of, yet, another, defenseless, black, person, at, the, hands, of, a, white, police, officer, a, tragic, mockery, to, the, truth, that, black, lives, matter, similar, to, other, americans, i, am, overcome, with, a, range, of, emotions, as, the, father, of, two, sons, and, as, a, black, man, myself, i, can, assure, you, that, i, am, furious, and, deeply, saddened, by, the, death, of, george, floyd, as, i, am, by, every, senseless, killing, of, black, males, and, females, in, america, it, could, have, been, either, of, my, sons, my, brothers, my, nephews, or, nieces, my, friends, or, even, one, of, my, students, who, lay, on, the, ground, pleading, for, mercy, on, that, horrific, day, looking, into, the, eyes, of, my, son, and, trying, to, help, him, comprehend, what, happened, and, what, is, happening, in, our, nation, i, am, cognizant, of, the, fact, that, i, am, old, enough, only, to, have, read, about, the, many, civil, rights, protests, and, nonviolent, demonstrations, that, have, afforded, me, the, opportunities, that, i, have, enjoyed, during, my, lifetime, while, i, was, not, an, eyewitness, to, the, protests, i, do, try, to, paint, a, picture, for, my, son, drawing, from, my, exposure, to, many, civil, rights, icons, and, their, recounting, of, historic, events, of, the, past, such, as, the, montgomery, bus, boycott, the, march, from, selma, to, montgomery, the, brutality, of, law, enforcement, officers, such, as, bull, connor, and, the, story, of, ruby, bridges, i, am, emotionally, distraught, about, the, stark, parallel, of, our, nation, present, state, of, affairs, and, our, nation, historical, past, i, have, been, giving, thought, to, this, national, crisis, especially, as, it, relates, to, alabama, state, university, rich, history, and, her, overwhelming, contributions, to, the, advancement, of, civil, rights, in, the, nation, i, am, one, of, thousands, of, students, who, have, matriculated, and, emerged, from, asu, with, purpose, and, a, true, understanding, of, social, justice, and, responsibility, at, asu, we, learned, the, importance, and, the, power, of, the, vote, the, call, to, public, service, and, advocacy, was, ingrained, in, our, dna, by, o, mother, dear, while, i, attempt, to, give, some, sensible, explanation, to, the, most, recent, senseless, acts, of, brutality, i, have, reflected, on, my, first, real, encounter, with, the, reality, of, racist, police, violence, against, blacks, in, america, it, was, the, spring, of, just, prior, to, my, senior, year, in, college, and, i, had, just, been, elected, president, of, the, student, government, association, this, was, the, time, that, our, nation, witnessed, rodney, king, being, brutally, beaten, by, los, angeles, law, enforcement, officers, after, he, led, them, on, a, chase, i, remember, asking, myself, is, this, what, would, happen, to, me, as, a, black, man, if, i, found, myself, in, a, similar, situation, with, authorities, i, vividly, recall, how, the, nation, erupted, into, protests, because, of, rodney, king, mistreatment, just, like, the, protests, that, have, erupted, nationally, because, of, the, senseless, death, of, george, floyd, and, others, each, incident, is, similar, to, the, protests, that, happened, across, this, nation, in, the, due, to, social, injustice, as, a, young, student, i, was, confused, and, enraged, by, what, i, witnessed, i, remember, the, rumbling, of, unrest, within, our, student, body, regarding, rodney, king, we, were, all, ready, to, act, on, our, anger, and, frustration, by, taking, to, the, streets, of, montgomery, to, let, our, voices, be, heard, word, of, our, intentions, reached, our, president, the, late, baker, who, later, became, one, of, my, mentors, my, sga, leadership, team, and, i, were, summoned, to, baker, office, and, it, was, there, that, i, learned, what, social, protesting, was, really, all, about, it, is, not, about, the, destruction, of, property, looting, or, acting, disorderly, it, is, about, banding, together, peacefully, with, a, common, goal, with, a, purpose, and, a, plan, for, change, during, the, meeting, we, discussed, our, desire, to, be, heard, and, our, passion, for, change, and, emerged, with, a, plan, for, a, peaceful, protest, on, the, campus, that, historically, has, been, a, beacon, for, our, home, our, alabama, state, university, this, focusing, event, allowed, me, to, lead, my, first, press, conference, it, would, be, the, first, time, i, had, ever, spoken, in, front, of, news, cameras, every, news, outlet, in, the, city, was, on, campus, that, day, as, students, gathered, with, community, stakeholders, in, great, numbers, i, led, the, protest, with, a, speech, students, and, local, elected, officials, were, also, able, to, have, their, voices, heard, as, the, media, captured, our, impassioned, sentiments, and, broadcast, the, event, i, share, this, personal, experience, not, only, to, highlight, the, importance, of, historically, black, colleges, and, universities, hbcus, in, providing, a, platform, for, change, but, also, to, emphasize, the, need, to, protest, peacefully, and, with, a, purpose, i, offer, that, advice, while, understanding, and, even, relating, to, the, rage, that, has, been, unleashed, across, the, nation, by, the, infection, of, racism, that, is, more, potent, than, ever, in, america, our, nation, has, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, george, floyd, can, plead, for, mercy, while, dying, publicly, under, the, force, of, a, racist, man, knee, just, as, his, forefathers, died, publicly, hanging, from, a, noose, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, a, young, man, by, the, name, of, michael, brown, can, hold, his, hands, up, in, surrender, and, still, be, shot, to, death, in, broad, daylight, in, ferguson, missouri, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, a, man, by, the, name, of, eric, garner, in, new, york, city, can, tell, authorities, i, ca, breathe, as, he, is, choked, to, death, the, infection, of, racism, is, new, and, improved, when, a, young, man, by, the, name, of, trayvon, martin, is, gunned, down, in, cold, blood, while, walking, from, the, store, to, his, home, racism, is, new, and, improved, when, ahmaud, arbery, can, be, gunned, down, while, jogging, not, far, from, his, home, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, breonna, taylor, can, be, shot, and, killed, by, police, officers, as, she, lay, sleeping, in, her, apartment, in, louisville, kentucky, let, us, not, forget, the, infection, of, racism, that, related, to, the, death, of, sandra, bland, who, was, found, hanged, in, a, jail, cell, in, walker, county, texas, after, being, arrested, for, a, minor, traffic, stop, here, in, montgomery, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, a, man, by, the, name, of, greg, gunn, who, attended, asu, is, chased, and, killed, by, a, police, officer, just, a, few, steps, from, his, mother, front, door, their, tragic, deaths, made, headlines, but, across, this, nation, and, even, in, this, city, we, could, easily, add, more, names, to, the, rolls, of, those, whose, lives, have, been, so, tragically, cut, short, with, no, cell, phone, cameras, to, capture, their, last, painful, breaths, with, this, in, mind, we, struggle, with, the, question, what, should, we, tell, our, students, the, answer, that, i, offer, you, is, the, same, that, i, give, to, my, sons, i, ask, that, you, find, ways, to, protest, peacefully, including, exercising, your, personal, responsibility, to, register, to, vote, and, then, go, vote, and, committing, yourself, to, continuing, your, education, so, that, you, are, prepared, to, emerge, as, this, nation, next, generation, of, leaders, i, ask, that, you, resist, the, temptation, to, channel, your, anger, into, destruction, instead, channel, your, energy, into, the, very, thing, that, disturbs, and, disrupts, those, who, would, oppress, you, education, our, nonviolent, stand, proved, successful, in, the, past, and, i, believe, it, could, be, the, catalyst, for, real, and, impactful, change, today, let, peace, be, at, the, core, of, all, of, our, actions, while, it, seems, as, though, remaining, calm, in, the, midst, of, a, racist, storm, is, a, signal, to, be, disrespected, disregarded, and, endangered, remember, the, lives, that, were, lost, to, get, us, to, this, day, remember, the, examples, of, those, who, were, brutally, beaten, and, rose, up, from, that, brutality, to, walk, the, halls, of, congress, to, become, mayors, governors, state, legislators, and, community, leaders, they, are, the, ones, upon, whose, shoulders, we, stand, their, sacrifices, have, afforded, us, the, opportunity, to, stand, and, take, up, the, mantle, of, peace, justice, and, equality, for, all, stay, in, the, fight, against, injustice, my, children, and, my, students, with, peace, purpose, and, a, plan, that, saves, us, from, and, allows, us, all, to, breathe, freely,
