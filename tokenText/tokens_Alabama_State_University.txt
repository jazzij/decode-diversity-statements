to, other, american, i, am, overcome, with, a, range, of, emotion, a, the, father, of, two, son, and, a, a, black, man, myself, i, can, assure, you, that, i, am, furious, and, deeply, saddened, by, the, death, of, george, floyd, a, i, am, by, every, senseless, kill, of, black, male, and, female, in, america, it, could, have, been, either, of, my, son, my, brother, my, nephew, or, niece, my, friend, or, even, one, of, my, student, who, lay, on, the, ground, plead, for, mercy, on, that, horrific, day, look, into, the, eye, of, my, son, and, tri, to, help, him, comprehend, what, happened, and, what, is, happen, in, our, nation, i, am, cognizant, of, the, fact, that, i, am, old, enough, only, to, have, read, about, the, many, civil, right, protest, and, nonviolent, demonstration, that, have, afforded, me, the, opportunity, that, i, have, enjoyed, dure, my, lifetime, while, i, wa, not, an, eyewitness, to, the, protest, i, do, try, to, paint, a, picture, for, my, son, draw, from, my, exposure, to, many, civil, right, icon, and, their, recount, of, historic, event, of, the, past, such, a, the, montgomery, bus, boycott, the, march, from, selma, to, montgomery, the, brutality, of, law, enforcement, officer, such, a, bull, connor, and, the, story, of, ruby, bridge, i, am, emotionally, distraught, about, the, stark, parallel, of, our, nation, present, state, of, affair, and, our, nation, historical, past, i, have, been, give, thought, to, this, national, crisis, especially, a, it, relates, to, alabama, state, university, rich, history, and, her, overwhelm, contribution, to, the, advancement, of, civil, right, in, the, nation, i, am, one, of, thousand, of, student, who, have, matriculated, and, emerged, from, asu, with, purpose, and, a, true, understand, of, social, justice, and, responsibility, at, asu, we, learned, the, importance, and, the, power, of, the, vote, the, call, to, public, service, and, advocacy, wa, ingrained, in, our, dna, by, o, mother, dear, while, i, attempt, to, give, some, sensible, explanation, to, the, most, recent, senseless, act, of, brutality, i, have, reflected, on, my, first, real, encounter, with, the, reality, of, racist, police, violence, against, black, in, america, it, wa, the, spring, of, just, prior, to, my, senior, year, in, college, and, i, had, just, been, elected, president, of, the, student, government, association, this, wa, the, time, that, our, nation, witnessed, rodney, king, be, brutally, beaten, by, los, angeles, law, enforcement, officer, after, he, led, them, on, a, chase, i, remember, ask, myself, is, this, what, would, happen, to, me, a, a, black, man, if, i, found, myself, in, a, similar, situation, with, authority, i, vividly, recall, how, the, nation, erupted, into, protest, because, of, rodney, king, mistreatment, just, like, the, protest, that, have, erupted, nationally, because, of, the, senseless, death, of, george, floyd, and, others, each, incident, is, similar, to, the, protest, that, happened, across, this, nation, in, the, due, to, social, injustice, a, a, young, student, i, wa, confused, and, enraged, by, what, i, witnessed, i, remember, the, rumbl, of, unrest, within, our, student, body, regard, rodney, king, we, were, all, ready, to, act, on, our, anger, and, frustration, by, take, to, the, street, of, montgomery, to, let, our, voice, be, heard, word, of, our, intention, reached, our, president, the, late, baker, who, later, became, one, of, my, mentor, my, sga, leadership, team, and, i, were, summoned, to, baker, office, and, it, wa, there, that, i, learned, what, social, protest, wa, really, all, about, it, is, not, about, the, destruction, of, property, loot, or, act, disorderly, it, is, about, band, together, peacefully, with, a, common, goal, with, a, purpose, and, a, plan, for, change, dure, the, meet, we, discussed, our, desire, to, be, heard, and, our, passion, for, change, and, emerged, with, a, plan, for, a, peaceful, protest, on, the, campus, that, historically, ha, been, a, beacon, for, our, home, our, alabama, state, university, this, focus, event, allowed, me, to, lead, my, first, press, conference, it, would, be, the, first, time, i, had, ever, spoken, in, front, of, news, camera, every, news, outlet, in, the, city, wa, on, campus, that, day, a, student, gathered, with, community, stakeholder, in, great, number, i, led, the, protest, with, a, speech, student, and, local, elected, official, were, also, able, to, have, their, voice, heard, a, the, medium, captured, our, impassioned, sentiment, and, broadcast, the, event, i, share, this, personal, experience, not, only, to, highlight, the, importance, of, historically, black, college, and, university, hbcus, in, provid, a, platform, for, change, but, also, to, emphasize, the, need, to, protest, peacefully, and, with, a, purpose, i, offer, that, advice, while, understand, and, even, relat, to, the, rage, that, ha, been, unleashed, across, the, nation, by, the, infection, of, racism, that, is, more, potent, than, ever, in, america, our, nation, ha, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, george, floyd, can, plead, for, mercy, while, die, publicly, under, the, force, of, a, racist, man, knee, just, a, his, forefather, died, publicly, hang, from, a, noose, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, a, young, man, by, the, name, of, michael, brown, can, hold, his, hand, up, in, surrender, and, still, be, shot, to, death, in, broad, daylight, in, ferguson, missouri, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, a, man, by, the, name, of, eric, garner, in, new, york, city, can, tell, authority, i, ca, breathe, a, he, is, choked, to, death, the, infection, of, racism, is, new, and, improved, when, a, young, man, by, the, name, of, trayvon, martin, is, gunned, down, in, cold, blood, while, walk, from, the, store, to, his, home, racism, is, new, and, improved, when, ahmaud, arbery, can, be, gunned, down, while, jog, not, far, from, his, home, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, breonna, taylor, can, be, shot, and, killed, by, police, officer, a, she, lay, sleep, in, her, apartment, in, louisville, kentucky, let, u, not, forget, the, infection, of, racism, that, related, to, the, death, of, sandra, bland, who, wa, found, hanged, in, a, jail, cell, in, walker, county, texas, after, be, arrested, for, a, minor, traffic, stop, here, in, montgomery, there, is, a, new, and, improved, infection, of, racism, when, a, man, by, the, name, of, greg, gunn, who, attended, asu, is, chased, and, killed, by, a, police, officer, just, a, few, step, from, his, mother, front, door, their, tragic, death, made, headline, but, across, this, nation, and, even, in, this, city, we, could, easily, add, more, name, to, the, roll, of, those, whose, life, have, been, so, tragically, cut, short, with, no, cell, phone, camera, to, capture, their, last, painful, breath, with, this, in, mind, we, struggle, with, the, question, what, should, we, tell, our, student, the, answer, that, i, offer, you, is, the, same, that, i, give, to, my, son, i, ask, that, you, find, way, to, protest, peacefully, includ, exercis, your, personal, responsibility, to, register, to, vote, and, then, go, vote, and, commit, yourself, to, continu, your, education, so, that, you, are, prepared, to, emerge, a, this, nation, next, generation, of, leader, i, ask, that, you, resist, the, temptation, to, channel, your, anger, into, destruction, instead, channel, your, energy, into, the, very, thing, that, disturbs, and, disrupts, those, who, would, oppress, you, education, our, nonviolent, stand, proved, successful, in, the, past, and, i, believe, it, could, be, the, catalyst, for, real, and, impactful, change, today, let, peace, be, at, the, core, of, all, of, our, action, while, it, seems, a, though, remain, calm, in, the, midst, of, a, racist, storm, is, a, signal, to, be, disrespected, disregarded, and, endangered, remember, the, life, that, were, lost, to, get, u, to, this, day, remember, the, example, of, those, who, were, brutally, beaten, and, rose, up, from, that, brutality, to, walk, the, hall, of, congress, to, become, mayor, governor, state, legislator, and, community, leader, they, are, the, one, upon, whose, shoulder, we, stand, their, sacrifice, have, afforded, u, the, opportunity, to, stand, and, take, up, the, mantle, of, peace, justice, and, equality, for, all, stay, in, the, fight, against, injustice, my, child, and, my, student, with, peace, purpose, and, a, plan, that, save, u, from, and, allows, u, all, to, breathe, freely, news, medium, contact, kenneth, mullinax
