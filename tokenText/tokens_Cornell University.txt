heard, have, horrified, u, and, broken, our, heart, we, are, ashamed, of, the, injustice, that, are, perpetrated, in, our, country, every, day, against, people, of, color, and, of, the, reality, that, year, after, cornell, wa, founded, to, help, heal, the, wound, of, a, broken, nation, that, nation, is, in, many, way, still, so, badly, broken, the, extraordinary, time, in, which, we, are, live, are, shine, a, spotlight, on, so, many, issue, of, equity, and, the, lack, of, it, on, the, way, that, right, and, opportunity, are, unevenly, distributed, across, our, society, and, the, worth, of, our, labor, and, our, life, unequally, valued, a, an, academic, community, built, on, the, bedrock, value, of, diversity, inclusion, and, openness, we, have, an, obligation, to, ensure, that, the,

word, are, important, word, matter, but, our, word, of, sympathy, of, support, of, shared, pain, are, not, enough, while, the, challenge, are, enormous, and, we, can, not, fix, them, on, our, own, that, doe, not, absolve, u, from, take, whatever, step, we, can, to, fight, against, systemic, racism, and, structural, inequality, a, a, community, we, can, and, must, act, through, our, teach, our,
