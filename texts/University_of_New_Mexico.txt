Leaders at The University of New Mexico have issued strong statements
condemning the brutal killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minnesota
on Memorial Day and the actions of those seeking to prompt further violence at
ensuing protests.
"Watching what is happening across our nation, I join the many voices who are
outraged and condemn not only the actions of the officers who killed George
Floyd, but police brutality against any and all communities of color," said UNM
President Garnett S. Stokes.
Following reports that extremist groups were using civil protests against police
brutality to further elicit violence, President Stokes stated that "peaceful protest
is a healthy way for people to express the hurt, fear and anger these types of
actions incite." She went on to say, "It is abhorrent that white nationalist groups
are taking cover behind legitimate national protests concerning George Floyd and
police brutality to provoke violence against black businesses and society at large."
UNM Police Chief Kevin McCabe issued the
following statement:
"What transpired in Minneapolis this past Memorial Day was appalling and
disgusting â€“ in my opinion, this does not represent American law enforcement and
those who committed this heinous act or stood by and did nothing to intervene
lack the humanity, integrity, and honor to wear the badge of a police officer.
Their senseless actions have stained every professional law enforcement officer
who swore an oath to protect and defend the communities they serve but it is
also a clear call for all of us to stand against this type of abuse of power.
As a police chief, to see this type of brutality makes me sick but I am confident
that justice will prevail in this case. I, along with every member of The University
of New Mexico Police Department, not only strive to do our very best every day
to protect and serve those within our community but also be examples of police
officers that our community expects and deserves."
