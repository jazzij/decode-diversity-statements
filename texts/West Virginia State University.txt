Dear West Virginia State Family:
Recently, our country has witnessed several tragic and racially-motivated incidents. The
heartbreaking deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and
Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia were all preventable incidents that were results of racial
ignorance and hate. Watching the news unfold, we are equally disturbed and share a deep
sense of concern and anguish.
As an Institution forged from the blood and sweat saturated dirt where slaves once laid, to
the halls in which Carter G. Woodson once walked and the airfields where Tuskegee
Airmen once trained, West Virginia State University takes great responsibility in
providing a nurturing and inclusive working and learning environment. To our students,
faculty and staff, though our doors are closed and halls are empty in response to COVID19 protocols, we still stand in solidarity with you and all those who face ongoing
systematic marginalization, racism and oppression.
For the past week, we have had discussions to determine the best medium to respond to
the events that are occurring in our nation. There is a prepared video message that will be
shared in the days ahead with the West Virginia State family and will be made available
throughout all social media platforms.
"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate;
only love can do that" - Martin Luther King, Jr.
