Black lives matter.  We stand with those protesting the racist killing of George Floyd. Too many have been killed: Breonna Taylor, Ahmard Arbery, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Quanice Hayes, Aiyana Jones, Eric Garner, Stephon Clark, Sandra Bland, Kendra James, Trayvon Martin, and the list goes on. We stand with those protesting long-standing racial injustice. We are acutely aware that machine learning algorithms trained with data that embodies the racial and social injustices of today will perpetuate and amplify these injustices in the future. Already we have witnessed applications of ML in law enforcement, policing, hiring, healthcare, and education that replicate or amplify existing biases. Any technology that unintentionally or by design marginalizes, excludes, or harms Black communities is damaging and dangerous. We recognize the hard work done by fellow ML researchers to shine light on these ill-conceived applications, and call on the ML community at large to take accountability for the societal impacts and consequences that our technology has on society and the world. Women in Machine Learning (WiML) reaffirms our commitment to promoting diversity and increasing the awareness of women, particularly Black women, in machine learning. n this vein, we want to highlight some impactful groups working to support Black students, researchers, and professionals in machine learning and computer science more broadly:
