Our world is in pain, from ills both medically treatable and socially teachable. Florida Tech is proud to have one of the most diverse student populations of any U.S. university. Justice and equality are core principles that we value here, and education sheds light where there otherwise was darkness. I look forward to the conversations we will have as a community of learners when students arrive for fall classes. Until then, I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy, open your minds to ideas that make you uncomfortable, and always treat your fellow humans with dignity and respect.
