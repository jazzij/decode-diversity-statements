A message of solidarity from UNLV President Marta Meana
MAY. 31, 2020
Dear colleagues and students,

It is with a heavy heart that I reach out to you in light of the appalling death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police. This is just the last in a far too long list of similar atrocities and there is only so much we can bear.

UNLV stands in solidarity with our African American faculty, staff, and students in denouncing this heinous act, in expecting accountability, and in demanding systemic change. The distress that this has caused in our community runs wide and deep. Racism is a far greater long-term threat to this country of ours than any virus. We need to confront it head on and together.

Universities have a responsibility to be beacons in the journey out of this unacceptable state of affairs. Let us double down on our efforts. We need to do this for each other. We need to do this for ourselves.

With sadness and hope,

Marta Meana, Ph.D.
UNLV President
