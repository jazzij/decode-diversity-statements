I am writing with a shared sense of shock, fear, outrage and sadness as we reflect upon the senseless killing of George Floyd as well as recent incidents of hatred, inequality and ensuing violence. This touches me deeply as it brings back scarred memories of years of racism and bullying I endured during my youth simply because of my ethnicity. I am forever grateful to my adopted country that has allowed me to heal my wounds and pursue my dreams.

Now, more than ever, it is time that we renew our own commitment to and uphold the values set forth in UTA’s Principles of Community. The basis for our UTA Community is mutual respect “…members of our community build trust by finding ways to communicate with one another respectfully. With civil discourse, our other principles will follow. Therefore, we will listen, not just to hear, but to try and understand.”

Our nation and our society face tremendous challenges in overcoming racism, discrimination and injustice. As scholars and students, teachers and mentors, I believe each of us at UTA has our own role in making a difference, changing all that is broken and accentuating the good I personally have experienced.

As Dr. Martin Luther King stated, “One of the great liabilities of history is that all too many people fail to remain awake through great periods of social change…Today, our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change.”

Let us commit ourselves to act with fairness, justice and mutual respect for all.
