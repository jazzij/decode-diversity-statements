Like you, I watch the dreadful images of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia, and despair at the death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, and others before them who have senselessly died.

At FIU we have a strong Black Student Union (BSU) and I appreciate the thoughtfulness I see in their leadership.

I also know that the vast majority of law enforcement officers respect and care for the communities they serve. Chief Alexander Casas and our entire FIU Police Department will continue to uphold their duties in protecting and serving our FIU community with a commitment to promote justice and equality for all.
