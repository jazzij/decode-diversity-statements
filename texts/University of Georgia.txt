I want to start by saying directly to you, I condemn racism in all its forms. The senseless acts of violence and hate that are taking place across the country have no place in our society. To our black students, staff, and alumni, I want you to know that I stand with you. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, along with too many others, have caused grief and adversely affected our lives and the lives of those we care about in significant way.

As these events have unfolded, I have worked with members of my administration to identify steps we can take to ensure that this institution is one where people are truly safe and supported. I want our University community to know that campus resources are available to support you. I encourage you to utilize them as needed to prioritize your wellbeing.

Again, I want to reinforce my firm belief that racism has no place in our society. During my presidency I have committed to working to create a UGA that is better tomorrow than it was yesterday. I know we donâ€™t always get it right, and mistakes are made. However, together, we must continue to move this work forward in a constructive manner despite all the challenges. In the days ahead, let us move forward in seeking racial justice by engaging in thoughtful listening and constructive dialogue, showing care and understanding, and by demonstrating our ongoing commitment to do better while working together for a more united and just world.
