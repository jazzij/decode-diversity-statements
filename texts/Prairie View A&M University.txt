We are mourning with George Floyd’s family, not only because he was one of our own, as a former student of Texas A&M University-Kingsville, but also because his death is truly a national tragedy.

It is important we all re-double our efforts to treat everyone, regardless of color, with respect and inclusion in every facet of American life, including our university system.

We at The Texas A&M University System are committed to this premise:  We are all God’s children and deserving of the same respect and protections that should be afforded every American.

— Chancellor John Sharp
