The IEEE Computer Society is, and remains, strongly committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion and we see no place for hatred and discrimination in our communities. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are central to the goals of the Computer Society and all of our activities. We are proactively supporting diversity and inclusion with the creation of a new taskforce this year that will address ways the Computer Society can improve its mission to better serve those most under-represented in our community. However, we know there is more we can do to support these ideals of equity, diversity, and inclusion.
