On Monday, May 25, 2020, George Floyd, an African-American man, was killed by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The gruesome event was captured on video, showing Mr. Floyd held on the ground, and the officers needs firmly push pressing against Mr. Floyd's neck. We witnessed with bewilderment the atrocious action by one whose pledged missions was "to protect and serve."

The faculty of Oakwood University School of Religion have come together to express our moral repulsion for the blatant disregard for human life expressed in this killing. Empowered by the Gospel of Christ, the biblical prophets, and our unique history as one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we take a stand against structural inequalities that perpetuate poverty, police impunity, the cruel disrespect for human life and personal dignity, and all other forms of injustice. Our commitment to educating young men and women who integrate faith, moral values, history, and respect for diversity and personal freedoms leads us ti condemn this act of racial hatred in the strongest terms possible.

In many cities in the United States and across the globe, many have taken to the streets to protest systemic racism that manifests itself in such acts of brutality and hatred. By the example of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we believe it is our duty to uphold the dignity of human life and unite with others in raising our voice to demand justice on behalf of God's children who have been dehumanized for too long in this self-professed "land of the free and the home of the brave."

Therefore,
- We demand that Mr. Derek Chauvin and the other former police officers who participated in this crime are served the justice they deserve.
- We demand appropriate and speedy compensation for the family of Mr. George Floyd.
- We demand an end to the militarization of police forces for in the United States and the retraining of all police officers as peace-keepers who are committed to protecting and serving the communities to which they are assigned.
- We must request for meetings with all law enforcement agencies in Madison and Limestone Counties to seek workable solutions. We do not want to witness a similar incident in our community.
