#BlackLivesMatter is not just a cardboard sign. White educators and PD providers: you have a role in ending systemic oppression. Have conversations about race in your classroom. Embed Black history in culturally sensitive curricula. Work to abolish the school-to-prison pipeline --see the effects of policing on yr own students. Support students as they work thru racial trauma. Really ask yourself what "equity" means in your work. No matter whether you can do it in the streets, you can in the classroom. https://twitter.com/trussleaders…/status/1267333391604527104
