I recall, back in early January, thinking about the powerful imagery of the year 2020 and imagining a world where we would have a better and more acute vision of our collective humanity. 

Now, nearly midway through this year, the quest appears even more pressing. Collectively, we are facing the challenge of a lifetime. In the midst of a pandemic, we watch as people across North America mobilize against injustice and racism, provoked in particular by the tragic death of George Floyd one week ago.

Feelings of sadness, anger, fear, and a sense of helplessness are shared by all of us. I recognize that many members of our community, especially our Black students, faculty, and staff, may need support at this time; resources are listed below. 

Yet, in this turbulent moment, it remains critical to remember that our strength lies in our unity and in living the principles that McGill embraces in its mission. Among those principles are equity and inclusiveness. Living these principles means going beyond publicly denouncing racism and other forms of social injustice. We are also called to consider how universities have the responsibility, to confront and work to flatten social inequities through dialogue and the advancement of knowledge. Every one of us shares in this responsibility as we live through a moment in history that calls for leadership and action anchored to knowledge, compassion, and courage.
