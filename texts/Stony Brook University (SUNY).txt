Recent events of the past few months have served as a profound reminder of the deep-seated racism, discrimination, and violence that plague the United States. As we reel over the senseless murders of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and remain outraged over the inexcusable actions of Amy Cooper, our nation confronts another devastating instance of police brutality. The killing of George Floyd serves as another painful example of the systemic racial disparities present in our country. This event is made even more poignant during this time of isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unequal burden of the disease on communities of color.
We must stand up and speak out against injustice and ignorance. As a public institution of higher learning, we must use our power to address major societal problems. We want to reiterate and reinforce Stony Brookâ€™s commitment to inclusion and acceptance of all who seek to work and study on our campus. We must actively work within our own communities to lead the change in our society we all want to see. By practicing inclusivity and celebrating the power and richness of diversity, we can stand together and remain unwavering in our embrace of the Stony Brook Community Pledge by promoting equality, civility, caring, responsibility, accountability, and respect.
As a community we must work together to drive positive change. We have asked our Chief Diversity Officer, Judi Brown Clarke, to reach out in the next few days with suggestions for how best to do that. In the meantime, please know that our campus resources are available to you should you need help in processing recent events.
