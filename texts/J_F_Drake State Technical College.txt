Dear Drake State Family,

As a community college, Drake State serves not only to educate but also enlighten and empower. We believe this important work includes a responsibility and commitment to diversity, inclusion and unity that strengthens our students, employees, and our community.

The frustration and pain caused by racism cannot, and should not, be dismissed. It should be held up to the light and exposed. As we collectively examine racial inequality in our country, let us be enlightened. Let us find our voices and constructive ways to work together with a fresh desire for change.

And while we work collectively, let us also remember our individual responsibilities which can also bring change. We must vote. We must complete the Census. We must call out injustice when we see it so it cannot hide.

We are all empowered to build a world that actively and systematically rejects racism. It is important work that will make us better. 

Sincerely,
Dr. Patricia Sims
