The tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis was extremely disturbing to watch. The national protests and unrest that have followed prompt me today to publicly reaffirm Utah State University’s and my own personal commitment to inclusion and respect in our Aggie family and in those communities we reach every day.

Clearly there are many troubling, systemic issues confronting us as a nation, and I think these highly volatile moments are opportune times for us to look inside ourselves to see how we can personally help address and alleviate injustice. These are the times for our Aggie Family to join together and reflect about our commitment to USU’s Principles of Community – our institutional Aggie pledge to diversity, human dignity and social responsibility.

Please join with me today as I reassert one of my critical obligations as university president: to cultivate an environment of respectful engagement and respectful discourse at every level of our society. Thank you.
