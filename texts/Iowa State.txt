I was saddened and outraged by the video in this week’s news showing the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers who were sworn to protect and serve their community. There is no justification for racism and brutality – ever – and especially not within the ranks of our public servants.
 The hurt and pain of this reverberates throughout communities across our country, including among our Iowa State community, and it is understandable that all eyes turn toward their local police departments for answers. I am proud to stand alongside our ISU Police Department and their record of professionalism — including racial intelligence and bias training and other professional development — under Chief Michael Newton’s leadership.
 That record speaks volumes for the level of safety and protection they provide 24/7 to our university community, and the level of respect they demonstrate in the daily situations they encounter and address. Last fall, the International Association of Chiefs of Police highlighted our ISU Police Department’s diversity and inclusion efforts through its Engagement and Inclusion Officers Team. 
I highly recommend you view this short video that describes, through the words of Chief Newton, Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Reg Stewart, students and others, how their efforts are working to foster a culture of respect and equity that allows our community to work and study without fear of, or discrimination by, the ISU PD. 
Chief Newton, his officers and staff are full partners with us in our commitment to the Principles of Community, and as each of us must rededicate ourselves to those principles. 
Tragedies like this must end. 
My continued thanks to all members of the Iowa State Community for caring and supporting each other
