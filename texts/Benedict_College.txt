I write when I am bothered...I am bothered tonight.
All day, I have watched social media and news with horror as protests borne out of an act of racial violence â€“ the murder of George Floyd - turned to violent demonstrations and even riots. As an African American I fully understand the hurt, anger and utter frustration that drives us to this point. The psychological trauma inflicted on African Americans every time a black life is cut short unnecessarily by a uniformed officer, cannot be understated, nor can it be dismissed. However, we must govern ourselves strategically and with discipline. We are strong, resilient, committed and brilliant. We must organize, plan and use our collective voices to bring about the change we seek.

I am asking you to do three (3) things:

1) Control Your Coins - Consistent, sustained economic pressure. We must stop spending and investing our money into businesses that do not respect and appreciate our buying power. Do not shop in stores where you are followed, ignored or treated rudely. We must never reward ignorance or disrespect. Today we have seen individuals post cruel and racist statements, jokes and pictures. Take note of where those people work. Report them and refuse to support the businesses that employ them.

2) VOTE. NEVER allow an election to occur without casting your VOTE. Educate yourself on the issues that impact our communities and vote out prosecutors and other elected officials who turn a deaf ear on the needs of our people. Attend candidate forums, write letters, attend meetings, volunteer and yes, donate to the campaigns of the candidates you believe in. History has demonstrated that we are a powerful voting block and when we show up!
