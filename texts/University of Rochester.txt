The past months have been challenging for all of us, and the last few weeks especially have laid bare the challenges that we as a society and as a University are facing with respect to the blight of systemic racism and racial injustice. The leadership of this institution is committed to candid conversations, to listening, and to real and effective action to address the concerns of our black students, faculty, staff, and alumni and their allies. And we recognize that this must be a shared commitment. We will be sending a broader message on this essential topic shortly.

Today, we are flying the University of Rochester flag on the Eastman Quadrangle and at the Medical Center at half-staff to commemorate todayâ€™s memorial service for George Floyd and as a step to demonstrating our public commitment to anti-racism in every area of this institution. We are all feeling the anguish of injustice today. I stand with you in sorrow and anger, and look forward to joining with you in doing the work that must be done.
