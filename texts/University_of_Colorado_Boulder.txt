From the Chancellor - Standing against hate and violence
May 29, 2020

As I see national news stories about the death of George Floyd and other recent acts of racism, I reflect on the conversations I had earlier this year with our students about these very issues. 

Even though a global pandemic is keeping us apart from each other, I share in your pain, anger and sadness. When we see acts of racism, it affects us deeply and takes a physical, mental and emotional toll. We must reach out and support each other as we process what has happened. For me, I will not lose hope. I take heart in how our students have engaged with us over the last academic year. We had honest conversations in a genuine effort to enhance campus climate together and build a more welcoming, safe and inclusive community for all.

These intolerable injustices, whether they happen in Minnesota, New York or here in Colorado, strike at the core of everything we believe. Let me be clear: I am committed to diversity and inclusion of everyone on our campus. 

We stand in solidarity with all members of our campus community, including our police department and the city of Boulder in encouraging and supporting peaceful demonstrations.

As a campus community, it is incumbent on us to encourage civil discourse that lifts us all from this darkness. Universities can be, and must be, at the heart of social change. As a campus, we continuously work to cultivate a diverse, inclusive and welcoming community. We best illustrate this through our moral actions when we see injustice, close to home or far away.

Please take care of yourselves, each other and use our campus support resources, which continue to be available during these difficult times.

CU Boulder Chancellor
