I know our Monarch community joins me in expressing our collective outrage regarding the horrific and senseless killing of George Floyd. We send prayers to his family as well as our hopes that his tragic death will create not just a nationwide conversation, but a commitment from every member of American society to say "No more" to what we observed in Minneapolis or, before that, in Georgia. As a diverse and inclusive campus, we must continue to do our collective best to demonstrate for the world that at Old Dominion University we strive to learn from differences, leading to a greater understanding of one another.
