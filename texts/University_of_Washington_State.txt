Denouncing racial violence and the ugliness of historic, systemic inequality, President Kirk Schulz and the university's executive leadership pledged greater accountability in confronting racial and social justice failures.

"We must consider our own roles in maintaining systemic racism and accepting racial violence, even when it makes us uncomfortable,"a letter from the university system's executive leadership team reads. "When our actions are informed by the truth of others, we can move forward, together, courageously and realize the aspirations of racial and social justice. Only then can we begin to create an authentic space from which to proceed."

In addition to Schulz, the letter was signed by interim Provost Bryan Slinker, incoming Provost Elizabeth Chilton and all chancellors and vice presidents.
