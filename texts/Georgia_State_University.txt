The senseless killings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd have brought forward understandable pain and anger about racism and violence against black Americans. There is no place for racism and violence in our society or at Georgia State.

As a society and a nation, we must be better. The racism and violence that plague our society must stop, and the healing must begin.

Atlanta‘s many decades of peaceful protest and advocacy for social justice have resulted in real and positive change in our society. Georgia State is an example of that change. Racial exclusion was replaced with inclusion, and racism was replaced with black students excelling as academic and community leaders. We’re on the right track, and through continued hard work and sustained commitment we will together help bring an end to the pain and injustice that ail our society.

Now, I ask each and every member of the Georgia State community to stand in solidarity in rejecting racism and violence and to commit to building a better future where opportunity is real and just.
