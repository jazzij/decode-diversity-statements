The University of Texas at Dallas - Office of the President
May 31, 2020

Over the last few days, I have heard from concerned students and colleagues about the horrific footage of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis.

I have watched the outrage over this tragedy from cities around the country. I have seen the emotional outpouring as people demand change in our society, and I have personally felt great anguish watching a defenseless man die while begging for help from those who are sworn to protect us.

As one who believes in the American ideal, this week has been difficult to comprehend. I know that I am not alone in questioning how our society can move forward when too many people are denied their rights. And so terribly often, those treated the most violently have been black.

Change must occur, and each one of us must play a role in effecting this change.

As president of UT Dallas, I reinforce the values of community, diversity and tolerance we share on our campus. I stress the imperative that we must live these values daily, and I emphasize the resolve we must have to honor this commitment now and into the future.

We, at UT Dallas, recommit to providing a safe, welcoming environment to all people, regardless of race, religion, ethnic origin, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation.

Each one of us — staff, faculty and students — must take these principles into our core if we are to have any hope of effecting change in our society. I ask that we all recommit ourselves so that, as Comets, we live the values we hope become reality for all people across our nation.

Let UT Dallas be a beacon of decency to the rest of the nation.

Sincerely,

Richard C. Benson
President
Eugene McDermott Distinguished University Chair of Leadership
