Like everyone in our community, I write to you today feeling sad and angry about the brutal killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, along with the racist incident in Central Park. 

I cannot begin to fathom the hurt GW’s Black students, faculty and staff may be feeling. My heart goes out to all who are suffering and may not feel safe. 

Please know that we continue to offer support and resources and are planning some online community events that are referenced in this message from Vice Provost Caroline Laguerre-Brown and the Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement.

While I wish we had the opportunity to host these conversations and support one another on campus, I know that we remain a strong community, and we will find ways to connect until our planned return to campus this fall. I look forward to working together—harnessing the power of the community that comprises this great institution—to address racism and injustice on our campus and in our society.
