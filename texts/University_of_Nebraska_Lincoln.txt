Chancellor Ronnie Green
Jane and I are sickened by the horrific injustice in Minneapolis, and the other forms of injustice that we know we don't see first-hand. Our hearts ache for the senseless loss of George Floyd and his family — and too many others.

Racism in any form is wrong and has no place in our lives, our communities, or institutions. Yet it remains.

Those of us entrusted to leading institutions must stay committed to truly listening, truly learning and to understanding our own bias. We need to encourage honest conversations, big and small, that can help bridge this divide and address deeply embedded histories of exclusion.

I hope and continue to believe that higher education, particularly institutions focused on access, can play a positive role in these conversations.
