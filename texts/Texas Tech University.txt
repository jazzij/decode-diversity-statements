We have all been affected and saddened by the tragic and violent events in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. The events have brought to mind difficult and complex questions about racism
and justice. For some of our fellow students, faculty, and employees, what happened to
George Floyd feels like it could happen to them too.
That requires all of us to have an extra measure of compassion and understanding as we
move forward. Take time to listen to one another, to have the hard conversations and
uncomfortable exchanges. It is precisely those dialogues that strengthen the sense of
community that is an essential part of our university.
I want to reaffirm Texas Tech's unwavering commitment to a welcoming environment for all.
Many ethnicities are proudly represented on this campus, and our students are drawn from all
50 states and more than one hundred countries. That is a great strength, but it also means that
all of us—the administration, faculty, employees, and students alike—must treat every
person in this community with the respect and compassion they deserve. That is our bedrock
standard, and no matter our background, our bond as Red Raiders unifies us in a common
cause and in our responsibility to one another.
This past spring, the University held a series of dialogues about race relations on campus,
and that work has never felt more urgent. We intend to continue these efforts in the year
ahead and I also want to call attention to the many resources that are here for students,
faculty, staff, and administrators in the meantime. We have first-rate health and counseling
services to support you and additional educational resources and programs are provided
through the Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, and the Center for Campus Life. We
will work with colleagues across the Texas Tech University System, the Athletics
Department, the Texas Tech Police Department, as well as with our elected officials and
civic leaders here in Lubbock, to ensure your safety and well-being.
We are all Red Raiders, and we are all dedicated to a University that celebrates diversity and
draws strength from it. Following the closures of this spring, we aim to return to campus as
unified as ever. That's the Texas Tech way. And it reflects our most deeply held values of
respect, inclusion, compassion, and mutual concern.
We look forward to being able to resume our campus life, and I wish all of you the best in the
weeks and months to come.
