Tiger Family:

By now, I know you are aware of the protests, riots and violence happening across the country ignited by the horrific death of Mr. George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a police officer. Here in Savannah, Mayor Van R. Johnson announced the implementation of a citywide curfew in effect from 8:30 pm to 7 am nightly while necessary.

There is a lot of unrest right now. Across the country, people (like our students, faculty, and ma) are hurting, angry, and weary. It is imperative that we work together to make things better for each other, our communities, and our country. I pray that each of you remain safe and I am praying for change and peace. We must end racism now!

Whatever your faith or belief system, I hope you join me in wanting better days and an end to racism, hatred and violence.

Stay strong Savannah State!
Kimberly Ballard-Washington
Interim President
