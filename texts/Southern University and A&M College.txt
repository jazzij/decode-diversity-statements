The Southern University System has a valued history of activism and impact across every state in this nation. It would be unfathomable to expect our students, alumni and others connected to our five campuses to not respond to the major injustices that have occurred in the past two months. We all hurt as we saw headlines and video footage of blatant disregard for human life. With so many of our students and alumni in the states that have had violence amid protests, know that we pray for your safety and peace in your hometowns. Continue to exercise your rights to peacefully activate, organize and strategize for change as we have collectively accomplished for 140 years. #WeAreSouthern
