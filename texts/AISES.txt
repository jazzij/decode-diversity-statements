The AISES family shares in the pain and grief of the black community resulting from the murder of George Floyd and the long history of oppression and violence against their communities. As indigenous people, at AISES, we are guided by the traditional knowledge of our ancestors who have lived and died upon these lands since time immemorial. Among this knowledge is the deep understanding that "we are all related." It is this respect for relationships and community that guides AISES' programs and partnerships. For example, for several years now, AISES has been a part of the 50k Coalition alongside the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Through partnerships like this, we have come to understand that our combined communities are stronger together. We have come to recognize that we are all working toward the same goals â€“ diversity, equity, and inclusion for all communities and have learned that we can support one another through the adversity and challenges our communities face day in and day out. As such, today and every day, we stand with our black brothers and sisters in solidarity against the continued violence and systemic oppression of their communities. #blacklivesmatter
