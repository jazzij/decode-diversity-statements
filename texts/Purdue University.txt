Events around our nation reminded us yet again of the work that remains for all of us in creating a country where racism and bigotry are eliminated and where African American men and women, boys and girls, can live without fear. We are angered and saddened by the death of George Floyd, the victims who came before him, and those killed or otherwise harmed in the wake of Mr. Floydâ€™s death. We hurt with those who are hurting and we pledge to continue to work toward a solution in which everyone is treated with civility and respect.
