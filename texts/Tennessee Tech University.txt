Our nation continues to be marred by injustice, racism, and violence. We observe recent events, that we have seen all too often, that threaten our ability to live with respect for each other.  The unwarranted death of George Floyd should never be forgotten.  I am saddened and struck with the overwhelming belief that we, as a nation, are better than this.

As a university community, we must take a stand and remain committed to our core values of inclusion, respect, kindness, and tolerance toward all.  Our students will be forever shaped by our words, actions, and response to the inexcusable treatment of people of color we have witnessed. 

At Tennessee Tech, we will be a safe place for African American students, faculty and staff. I ask you to hear their voices and pray that all of us will be granted an extra measure of Godâ€™s wisdom, grace, tolerance, and patience as we listen to each other and stand beside one another.
