As the U.S grapples with the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbury and many other black men and women, it is during this painful time that we explicitly condemn racism and systematic oppression, and call for genuine change. We stand with the Black community and against anti-Blackness.
AnitaB.org was founded to increase the representation of women in in technology and ensure that women’s voices play a key role in shaping the future of the industry-and the extension of the world.
In the past, living mission-while created with the most progressive intentions- has sometimes fallen short of supporting every woman. Like many organizations’ histories, ours holds moments of erasure when it comes to uplifting Black people and women, the people who need it the most. We are working hard to live our values, both within our organization and as we work with our Partners to do the same.
We cannot allow this moment to pass us by and call our Partners to take action, including:
•        Increase your diversity. Hire Black people.
•        Contribute to the organizations that support the promotion of Black and other marginalized people.
•        Partner with public officials to change laws and policing to protect everyone.
•        Support protestors throughout the country by donating to bail funds.
The time is now to change our culture, create a more equal society and move forward together.
