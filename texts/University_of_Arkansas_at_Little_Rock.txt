UA Little Rock Stands with Students, Faculty, and Staff
JUNE 2, 2020

Trojan Family,

This is a difficult time for our country as we struggle with the harmful effects of racism. We grieve with the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and so many others. I want you to know that UA Little Rock stands against racism and hate and stands with those who support social justice and equality.

As an institution, we are not immune to issues of inequity and intolerance. Particularly with regard to issues of race and ethnicity, we have not done enough. While we still have much room for improvement, we are committed to doing the work that is required of us to ensure we provide members of our campus community with the space and support to operate authentically in their identity, free from harassment and disrespect.

I know there are members of our campus community, especially those who identify as African American, who are in great pain at this time as you struggle to process this latest tragedy, while navigating the enduring systems of discrimination that you face in your day-to-day life. We want you to know that you have a place at UA Little Rock, and it is important that we continue to work together to ensure the safety and well-being of every member of our campus community. We are here for you and we care for you. You matter.

I am committed to making sure that every member of our campus community is valued, respected, and celebratedâ€“we are stronger together.
