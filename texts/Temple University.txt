Recently, we have watched the horrific accounts of the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Temple joins those who oppose racial oppression and are actively working toward racial equity. Our university was built on the idea that the world is filled with diamonds and these diamonds can be found anywhere and everywhere regardless of race, ethnicity or socio-economic background. As an educational institution, Temple promotes critical thinking and peaceful and purposeful activism. We join with leaders in the Philadelphia region in condemning violence that harms others and destroys property.

Last week, students, faculty and staff were invited to take part in programming and support services designed to help the Temple community process and constructively respond to this difficult season in our shared history. This programming will continue, led by Temple’s Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity, Advocacy and Leadership (IDEAL). We invite you to join with IDEAL for an “Envisioning Racial Justice” webinar to be held Tuesday, June 2. IDEAL regularly shares recommendations of books, articles and other valuable resources, like How To Be An Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi. Not only is Dr. Kendi a National Book Award-winning and No. 1 New York Times Bestselling Author, he is a Temple Owl, having received his doctorate in African American Studies in 2010. Follow @templediversity for the most up-to-date recommendations and information about additional events.

If you believe you have been the victim of racial discrimination or harassment, please contact the university's EOC office, the focal point of Temple's institutionwide efforts for equal opportunity, equal access and affirmative action. Tuttleman Counseling Services and the Employee Assistance Program also remain available to support you as we face these challenges.

We have every confidence we will navigate this difficult time together.
