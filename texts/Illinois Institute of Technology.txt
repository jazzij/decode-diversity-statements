As the events following the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have created unrest in our city, state, and nation, I want to reaffirm our unwavering support of our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and Bronzeville neighbors of African descent. Simply put, the university unequivocally condemns discrimination and violence against all African Americans within our community and across the country. 

The pain and outrage that many of us feel at this time is palpable. I reaffirm this university’s ongoing and strong commitment against racism of all kinds. Our university is dedicated to peacefully working with our community to reject fear, violence, and injustice and to contribute to positive change in Chicago and in our nation. 

Our university was founded to bridge inequity in education and opportunity—and that informs every aspect of who we are as a university. As outlined in our Statement on Community, Inclusion, and Diversity, “We embrace the contributions that differences offer.”

Please stay safe during this difficult time.
