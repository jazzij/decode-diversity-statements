Along with so many of you, I was sickened by the footage of George Floyd’s horrific death on a Minneapolis, Minnesota street while in police custody this week. Although this took place nearly 2,000 miles from Tucson, it resonates here and across this nation with every person who expects basic human rights and demands equal justice for all. Mr. Floyd’s tragic death stands in stark contrast to these minimal societal expectations, and the senseless and unnecessary taking of his life is both heartbreaking and infuriating. 

We should collectively stand together in advocating for civil, educational, economic and healthcare justice for all of our Black sisters and brothers. The Floyd family and those who have previously suffered such devastating loss deserve nothing less. As our University of Arizona family promotes and strives to live by our core values, painful chapters such as these illustrate how important such values are to our community fabric. Compassion, integrity and inclusion can help us move forward, and demand better. As a community, we must challenge ourselves to do more to be welcoming, inclusive, supportive and kind — and to stand side by side with the most vulnerable among us. 
 
My role as President of the University of Arizona presents unlimited opportunities to serve with you. The best part of any day is making a positive difference in someone’s life, and I know I am not alone in that feeling, which we all have experienced in good times and bad. Make no mistake about it, this is a very challenging time for our faculty, staff and, particularly, for our students. Please know useful resources are available:
•        Counseling and Psych Services
•        Dean of Students Office
•        Student Wellness
•        African American Student Affairs
This difficult period will not define who we are, but our collective response to it will. I remain committed to advancing equity and justice on our campus and in our community.
 
Please stay safe and take care of each other.
