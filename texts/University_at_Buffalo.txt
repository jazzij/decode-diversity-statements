Minneapolis, Louisville, Atlanta
Published May 30, 2020

Dear university community,

At the University at Buffalo, we believe that intolerance, hatred and institutional racism have no place in our community or our nation. That is precisely why our university—in principle and in practice—has deliberately cultivated a diverse, inclusive community grounded in respect for each other’s humanity.
 
As a university community, we are deeply saddened by the lives senselessly taken in Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville. As we watch neighborhoods and cities consumed by destruction and chaos, we mourn peacefully but not passively.
 
Instead, with unwavering compassion, let us lift our voices together and, as one, pledge that all people—regardless of race or gender—be afforded a life of liberty, equality, opportunity and dignity.

Sincerely,
 
Satish K. Tripathi
President
