TTIC's Mission Statement says: "TTIC is committed to the values of human freedom, dignity, prosperity, and diversity." President Turk confirmed in an internal mail to the TTIC community on Tuesday that the Institute is firmly committed to those values, and supports those demanding an end to intolerance, discrimination, marginalization, and bigotry. Racism and discrimination have devastating effects on society. Silence plays a key role in upholding and supporting narratives that contribute to systems of oppression and injustice.

The recent killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, along with too many others, have caused profound new grief and adversely affect our lives and the lives of those we care about in significant ways. We must individually and collectively reflect on the lives lost unnecessarily, and the systemic problems and challenges we all face as a society. The unnecessary race-based killings and violence must end.
