I write today to share our pain, sadness, and anger for the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the midst of this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the all too common violence and threat of violence perpetrated against Black people and other communities of color in our country escalates. George Floydâ€™s death is part of an appalling history of racist harassment, assault, and murder that stretches back far too long in the life of our nation. There are too many victims whose experiences never made headlines and whose names will never become public. I know that grief weighs heavily on many members of our community. I struggle with my own sense of heartbreak.

Our university struggles with and works within the same context of white supremacist systems, structures, and conditions that make life more dangerous and precarious for people of color. Universities, like our country, have taken too long to translate our ideals into action or sustainable change. Transforming the university takes work, and we are still engaged in that work. The pace of change is frustratingly slow and the instruments of change are imperfect. The difficulties of this past year for our community highlight how far we have to go. 

I encourage you to reach out to campus services for support. In addition to support services offered by staff in our colleges and resource centers, Counseling and Psychological Services provides assistance for students. For employees, the Employee Assistance Program can provide counseling and support.
