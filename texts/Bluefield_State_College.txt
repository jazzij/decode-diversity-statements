The Bluefield State College community is united in mourning the tragic and senseless death of George Floyd. Each of us should be deeply saddened by the hate that was expressed by this terrible act. The late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "We must learn to live together as brothers or we will perish together as fools." Racial discrimination cannot be tolerated in America. Bluefield State is a Historically Black College that serves a population that is diverse, but we are a community where each member must passionately embrace the belief that people of color cannot continue to suffer because of racism. We MUST resolve to love our brother, because hatred can destroy us all. The journey forward can only be made with heartfelt, lifelong, commitment to love, to forgive and to ask for forgiveness, and to listen and learn. We lift up our collective prayers for Mr. Floyd and his family, for the African American community- both locally and nationally- and for each other. The journey will be challenging, but it can also be infinitely rewarding. As Dr. King noted, "You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step." -President, Robin Capehart, Bluefield State College
