JSU Family,
Right now, our country appears to be standing on the precipice of monumental change. We can see it. We can hear it. We can feel it.
HBCUs have a long-standing history of being a space rooted in the fight for civil rights, equality, and liberation. Our purpose at Jackson State University has always been to educate, enlighten, encourage, and inspire our community.
We push our students to be transformative leaders who challenge societal norms to improve conditions for the betterment of others.
As acting president, I recognize that education does not only come from within the classroom but also in the community during times of adversity. As a father, I care deeply about the country that will remain for my daughters after I am gone. As a Black man, who has experienced racism, it is not enough to simply denounce racial bias, violence, and aggression. This moment calls for a real examination of Americaâ€™s consciousness.
I ask every person affiliated with Jackson State University to remember our purpose and mission as we stand in the fight for social justice and equality.
Together, we are #JSUStrong.
 - Thomas Hudson, acting president of Jackson State University
