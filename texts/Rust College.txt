Dear Rust Family,
After several months of being socially distant, the brutal murder of Mr. George Floyd refocused Americaâ€™s attention on the virus of racism which has been with us for so long. While it would be easy to be discouraged, seeing the largely peaceful protests unfolded around the globe has been heartening. At Rust College, we have been inspired for years by the courage and commitment of our alumna, Ida B. Wells, in her work to end lynching and provide opportunities for Black Americans to more fully participate in society. I challenge each of us to take time to reflect on how we can use our talents, skills, and abilities to make America a more just and equitable nation. Your preparation at Rust College is the platform for your involvement in making your community a better place. I pray that you are healthy and safe and look forward to seeing you back on campus in the future.
Sincerely,
President Ivy R. Taylor
