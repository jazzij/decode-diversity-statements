Over the past several days, Clarkson University has joined the nation in grieving the death of George Floyd. The subsequent protests are more than just a response to an isolated incident. Change is necessary.
Clarksonâ€™s core values call us to work towards addressing deep-rooted issues of racial inequality at the heart of these events. We must do so both locally and nationally through intentional actions and with respect to the dignity of our community members.
To our students, employees and alumni who are hurting, we offer our support and our resources.
For those who want to do something to make a difference,  by using our individual and collective voices participate in our Community Meeting on Thursday, June 4 at 7pm Eastern time
connect to the Clarkson community members below and reach out to your elected officials (https://usa.gov/elected-officials) to share the change you want.
