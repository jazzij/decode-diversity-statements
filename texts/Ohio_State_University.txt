We typically share with you a weekend email update on various COVID-19 related issues. We will send the update on Monday this week. 

I ask instead that we use this weekend to reflect on the horrific events of the past week and specifically on what we as individuals, as a community, and as a nation must do to prevent crimes like this from happening again. What can we do to make things different? 

George Floyd suffered a horrendous and completely unnecessary death. His killing, and those that have come before, demand that we create a different future. This can and must be our task. 

This time, we must act. That starts with dialogue, which I have renewed with key community partners. We must reaffirm our commitment as Buckeyes to our university values of inclusion, diversity and tolerance.

Today, let us also act by reflecting on whatâ€™s in our hearts and directing our activities to collaborative efforts to produce lasting change.
