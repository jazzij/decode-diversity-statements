ear, members, of, the, yale, community, i, write, to, you, today, deeply, upset, by, the, killing, of, george, floyd, while, he, was, in, the, custody, of, minneapolis, police, officers, floyd, death, follows, a, pattern, of, racial, injustice, that, has, become, too, familiar, in, our, country, and, that, amounts, to, a, national, emergency, at, a, time, when, the, american, community, must, come, together, more, than, ever, before, george, floyd, horrifying, death, shocks, our, shared, conscience, and, indicts, our, shared, failure, it, can, and, must, remind, us, of, other, similar, killings, and, of, the, racism, nativism, and, bigotry, too, pervasive, in, society, today, and, throughout, our, country, history, over, the, past, week, i, have, been, thinking, about, two, seemingly, incongruous, our, sense, of, community, and, one, of, our, most, basic, emotions, fear, since, the, start, of, the, pandemic, legitimate, fear, has, been, very, much, with, us, but, not, just, about, the, virus, itself, and, not, among, us, equally, from, reports, of, racism, against, people, of, asian, descent, to, the, unacceptable, disparities, in, health, outcomes, and, health, care, there, was, every, reason, for, us, to, fear, for, the, safety, of, our, neighbors, and, family, members, and, of, some, sadly, more, than, of, others, at, the, same, time, i, saw, nurses, doctors, support, staff, and, volunteers, act, with, courage, selflessness, and, compassion, in, our, home, city, and, around, the, world, we, nurtured, a, growing, sense, of, community, which, gave, us, the, optimism, and, hope, that, must, ever, be, a, cornerstone, of, our, beloved, country, it, is, in, the, face, of, that, noble, expression, of, solidarity, that, george, floyd, death, has, shaken, us, and, the, shared, spirit, of, heroism, we, have, aroused, to, fight, the, pandemic, as, i, read, the, news, reports, of, floyd, death, and, its, explosive, response, i, knew, that, many, members, of, our, community, feel, fear, in, their, daily, lives, because, of, the, injustices, they, have, experienced, and, witnessed, and, i, thought, of, how, fear, so, reliably, leads, to, anxiety, depression, health, deterioration, and, anger, and, also, to, aggression, and, even, violence, some, of, the, protests, have, turned, destructive, undermining, the, plea, for, justice, all, americans, must, share, fear, is, powerful, damaging, and, unpredictable, in, its, effects, i, believe, that, all, of, us, at, yale, must, do, what, we, can, to, replace, fear, with, and, not, with, anything, less, than, action, here, i, have, been, thinking, much, of, the, life, of, the, extraordinary, pauli, murray, a, lawyer, civil, rights, leader, and, yale, law, school, graduate, she, experienced, firsthand, the, cruelties, of, racial, segregation, and, suffered, injustices, she, knew, fear, however, she, wrote, in, her, memoir, seeing, the, relationship, between, my, personal, cause, and, the, universal, cause, of, freedom, released, me, from, a, sense, of, would, be, no, less, afraid, to, challenge, the, system, of, racial, segregation, but, the, heightened, significance, of, my, cause, would, impel, me, to, act, in, spite, of, my, fears, i, have, implored, and, earnestly, invite, you, to, do, the, to, make, direct, use, of, pauli, murray, wisdom, her, words, remind, us, of, all, that, we, have, been, able, to, accomplish, together, because, of, our, shared, commitment, to, the, common, good, since, we, have, saved, lives, in, this, pandemic, we, have, isolated, ourselves, changed, the, way, we, live, and, sacrificed, to, safeguard, the, of, the, most, vulnerable, among, us, and, prevent, our, hospitals, from, becoming, overwhelmed, it, is, vital, to, remember, that, we, have, been, united, in, easing, suffering, improving, lives, and, providing, hope, during, a, turbulent, and, challenging, period, of, our, history, if, we, can, do, this, we, are, capable, all, of, us, of, creating, the, america, we, must, insist, belongs, to, us, all, in, pauli, murray, wrote, as, an, american, i, inherit, the, magnificent, tradition, of, an, endless, march, toward, freedom, and, toward, the, dignity, of, all, mankind, we, have, so, much, more, to, do, to, foster, and, sustain, an, equitable, society, instead, of, feeling, the, isolating, effects, of, fear, when, our, sense, of, community, is, shaken, we, must, remember, that, we, are, connected, in, more, ways, than, we, are, divided, and, that, where, we, are, divided, we, must, work, now, in, the, interest, of, unity, and, justice, this, is, a, matter, of, the, highest, importance, so, let, us, act, as, pauli, murray, would, have, us, act, toward, those, we, know, well, but, also, those, to, whom, we, are, connected, simply, by, a, common, and, powerful, dream, i, am, grateful, that, you, and, i, share, yale, and, its, mission, to, improve, the, world, today, and, for, future, generations, in, looking, forward, to, the, work, we, have, ahead, of, us, i, wish, you, peace, and, strength, with, best, wishes, for, your, health, and, safety, peter, salovey, president, chris, argyris, professor,
